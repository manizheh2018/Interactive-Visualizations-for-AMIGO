Sometimes 22oz is just more than I want. Pour was smooth, moderate carbonation. Gold in color. Hazy. Very nice fruity, hoppy smell. Enjoy the grapefruit smell while raising to your nose.

Aroma is of caramel, grapefruit, herbal hops, and toasted grain. This is a very hoppy beer. Lots of citrus and pine are present. A touch of caramel is in the background. There is a sharp lingering bitterness on the finish. Medium bodied and an easy drinker. A very nice IPA and its made even nice by the fact it comes in a can. Perfect for a round of golf or other outside activities.","1278: Slightly hazed orange-amber with a towering head of persistent, lumpy foam. Sugary citrus zestiness, green pine, and a crackery\u002fdoughy note in the nose. Very smooth hoppy flavor. It doesn't smack you in the face with any sort of brashness, just lovely fresh hops...orange and pine (definitely some Simcoe in there) with a gradualy increasing bitterness that tends to stick to the inside of the mouth. Not particularly \"bright\", it leans more towards the dark and dank side with just the right amount of malty sweetness and a touch of honey. Medium bodied, oily, and bitter.

Pour was smooth, moderate carbonation. Gold in color. Hazy. Very nice fruity, hoppy smell. Enjoy the grapefruit smell while raising to your nose. Taste was very well balanced for IPA. Hoppy but not out of control. Very nice mouth feel, which makes this a very drinkable beer. White head, with a moderate lacing. This is a good beer. I would describe it as a, \"very drinkable\" beer. Enjoy!","443: A: Poured a dark amber with good carbonation leaving a nice white head S: Citrus and pine notes with light booze, light caramel and bread T: Some piney resin, floral and citrus notes with a nice sharp hop bite M: Good carbonation and feel but a little light on the body, maybe I am just used to drink to many IIPAs that i am tainted D: Good and worth a try.","872: one word WOW! this has to be one of the hoppiest beers I've ever had, the hop profile is well preseved inside its 12 oz can. Pours a warm copper color with a huge floral aroma of hops. I would say the freshness of the hops makes it almost over hopped and hard to drink. But, it is a must for any hop head to try. Not your average canned beer...try one you love it or hate it...","1414: I had this one on tap at the Horse Brass in Portland, Oregon. It came in dark orange\u002fgolden color with a good sized frothy white head that left lacing on the glass all the way down. It smelled very hoppy and sweet\u002fsour in a citrus way as well. The taste was great. Very hoppy and bitter with a kind of sweet citrus tone to it as well. Mouthfeel was good, this one has some bite and it left a dry\u002fbitter aftertaste that made my mouth water for more. Overall this is a good beer, tastes great, goes down smooth, doesn't disappoint.","1705: A: Slightly hazy copper color with a slight off-white head and pretty intense lacing. S: Pine hops and a lot of caramel malts. T: Pretty fair balance between the hops and malts. Nice amount of hops upfront and then a lot of bready malts with a slightly burnt flavor to them. Crisp and pretty easy to drink. Without a doubt the best IPA I've ever had from a can.","1894: Almost totally black. Beige foam, quite compact, not bad. Light smell, just a bit of roast, and some hop. A bit too light. The taste is light oo, and drinkable, with some malt, roast, hints of coffee. Nothing exceptional, but after all drinkable and pleasant. Light to average body. In the aftertaste some dust, somr roast, hint of caramel, and a bit of bitterness. No defect, drinkable, not bad.","18: Pours a slightly hazy copper color with about one and a half fingers of creamy, white colored, head that has great retention. Aroma is of caramel, grapefruit, herbal hops, and toasted grain. This is a very hoppy beer. Lots of citrus and pine are present. A touch of caramel is in the background. There is a sharp lingering bitterness on the finish. Medium bodied and an easy drinker. A very nice IPA and its made even nice by the fact it comes in a can. Perfect for a round of golf or other outside activities.","36: 22 oz. bomber, A: Pours a clear yellow with a mild white head, good retention. S: Great nose of ginger, honey, perfume. T: Rather light upfront, it reminds me of Lawnmower, with a hint of ale fruitiness\u002fKolsch-like almost. Good ginger honey notes on the back end, not taking over the beer in any way. The ginger flavour is clear, but I wanted it to come out a little more in the end. M: Very light-bodied, watery, light base beer for sure. D: An easy drinking spiced beer, this will offend no one, but there's not a complexity to this brew at all.","179: Strong hop bittering married to a coffee-enhanced roastiness with a surprising malt turnaround towards the finish. This stout is black as it gets with modest brown head and lace. The mouthfeel is notably well contoured. The flavor and aroma of this 2004 winter seasonal approach being outright carbonized. You can almost literally taste the blackness of this doubly roasted brew. Dark and hearty though at times cloying.","194: Pours nice, great head retention, no nose at all. Nice 1st hit bitter followed by what I thought would be a little sweet malty finish. Wrong at death a killer long lasting bitter hit on the back of the tounge. The finish lasts forever. Overall not a killer IPA, but certinly a very tasty drinkable brew that's a lot different than Caldera IPA. I like it, worth a try, if you like IPA's.","288: Orange color for a beer with orange in the name. Minimal head, its all good. Definite citrus (orange?) hop impressions here. Pleasant. Dry taste, moderate bitterness, full hop mouthfeel. Easy to drink. Not overpowering hop presence, but good nonetheless, gives it the delicate and on point treatment moreso than just simplistic bitter brutality. Crystal and caramel malt seem to be kicking it here. Stayed away from sweet territory. Definitely gets its orange name from the hop impressions, not the addition of fruit.","410: Thanks to inflatablechair for sending out this great extra last month. Shared with a few others last saturday night. Poured a nice reddish brown color, with a bit of tan head on top. Aromas of toasted malt, caramel, orange zest and yeast. Medium bodied, with flavors of orange, caramel, toasted malt and yeast.","525: Pours a deep shade of gold with a fluffy ecru head. The aroma is biscuity, bolstered by grapefruit hops. The brew slides across the tongue, nice and oily. Malt and hops hold together in a nice balance, the hops always penetrating but never dominating. A tad sweeter than I'd like with a mild butter profile. This is a good, but not great, beer.","636: this is my first Caldera brew have seen cans of pale ale and ipa before. Upon pouring this ipa i saw a hazy amber beer with a thick dull white head and smelled hops. A goodstart to an ipa. The smell is of citrus-grapefruit, earthy, and a hint of pine. The taste is pungent grapefruit, battling pine, and subtle sweet malt flavor. Not the most complex beer but all the same good.","781: Pours a bright and clear amber color with a nice head. Aromas are subtle, some malts, and a bit of sweetness. Flavors are similar to that of brewed tea, with some malt sweetness and creaminess. The finish is crisp and a tad bitter from the hops. Mouthfeel is pretty good, a nicely carbonated beer. Very session worthy amber. Nothing special, but it's simple and tasty.","870: Great to see this Oregon brewery now in my area.Poured a deep hazed burnt orange with a tight formed slight off white crown that held well,big citric aromas with a bit of pine resin,a biscuit dough aroma lends a little maltiness to the mix.Deep grapefruit rind flavors really stand out,this is a true American ipa with its hop forward profile,a lightly sweet biscuit dough malt base stands up well to the big hop presence.A solid beer,to me what an American ipa should be.","872: one word WOW! this has to be one of the hoppiest beers I've ever had, the hop profile is well preseved inside its 12 oz can. Pours a warm copper color with a huge floral aroma of hops. I would say the freshness of the hops makes it almost over hopped and hard to drink. But, it is a must for any hop head to try. Not your average canned beer...try one you love it or hate it...","928: I have been thinking of picking up a bottle of this for a while pours a deep deep red, glowing, standing out a lot smell of slight smoke, peat, a bit of cherry, bbq Taste is mostly peated malt smoke, a lot of it...i was expecting more smokey, not peated. still a bit of darker, roasted fruits, a bit of burnt sugar, some peanut but overall makes it pretty unique. Mouthfeel is really smooth, lower carbed tickles the tongue just right, goes down well Overall its not bad, but as far as a rauch, feels like to much of that peated taste, dont know if I would pick it amongst other smoked beers.","942: Good pale ale. Out of a can is a novelty. Made this and a few others a great choice for craft beer golfing fare. Tastes great. Lots of grapefruit and pine notes, but it's the stoutish chocolate backbone that makes this a real winner. Far more earthy than some other, more popular pale's out of bottles nonetheless. Very tasty. Will definately revisit. Drawbacks... not many... a little sour in the finish when the choco and malt dissapates.... could also be the can talking here... but regardless this is one dam^ fine pale ale. a little pricey around here at 10.99\u002fsix doesn't help either... sure it's less near the source.... will take it for another round soon.","1089: Comes out of the tap an opaque deep sable with a minimal head, but the latter may be an artifact of te pour. Smoky aroma has tones of molasses and high-quality coffee. Absolutely delicious flavor has roast coffee, chocolate and molasses components and is just slightly sweet - and superb! Smooth, fizzy texture is extremely pleasing. If you visit the Pacific Northwest, look for this one!","1127: Let me start by sharing what's on the side of the bottle: \"For all you people who are afraid of beer you can't see through, this one is for you. This beer is yellow, fizzy, and clearly meant for washing dirt out of your mouth after mowing the lawn.\" I'm not even sure it's good for that. It's definitely yellow and fizzy, with no head to speak of, and zero lacing. It almost smells like a loaf of bread, and nearly tastes the same. It's very earthy and grainy with nary a hop to be found. Man, I love me some Caldera, but I would rather drink a Bud Light than this on a hot summer day. Sorry guys, but this beer gets an F.","1376: A- Nice golden color. Looks what a pale ale should. There is very little head, which resembles that of something that is going to have a lot of hops. We will see... S- Why yes I can smell those wonderful whole flower cascade hops. T- There is a nice maltyness with this beer. Not so much of a hop taste, but it is there. M- Feels a bit slimy, or at least makes my mouth become slimy. D- I can drink it with the greatest of ease.","1400: Review from BeerAdvocate Magazine Issue #42 (Jul 2010): YES! More craft brewers need to adjunct their beer. The lacing has staying power, though the haze on the yellow is distracting. This lager packs a yeasty, grassy aroma. Crisp and a bit slick, obvious light body. Fresh- cut grass and nutty yeast coat the palate; hops are fresh with ample bitterness and a good amount of flavor, which brings this beer up a few notches. The maltiness is a bit light, but right where it's supposed to be. Flavor overrides cleanliness. Very drinkable as well.","1414: I had this one on tap at the Horse Brass in Portland, Oregon. It came in dark orange\u002fgolden color with a good sized frothy white head that left lacing on the glass all the way down. It smelled very hoppy and sweet\u002fsour in a citrus way as well. The taste was great. Very hoppy and bitter with a kind of sweet citrus tone to it as well. Mouthfeel was good, this one has some bite and it left a dry\u002fbitter aftertaste that made my mouth water for more. Overall this is a good beer, tastes great, goes down smooth, doesn't disappoint.","1450: Picked up a six pack of this one in a recent trade. Pours out a nice orange color with a smallish head. Aromas of oranges, pine and hops. On the palate, this one is very hoppy and enjoyable to drink. Another nice canned beer, enjoyable in the summer sun.","1848: A: Dark amber with a slight hint of red. S: Lots of citrus, but it's kind of weak. T: Good hop flavor, pretty bitter. You get an immediate citrus flavor followed quickly by the bitterness. M: Medium body, a little too bitter and malty on the aftertaste for me. Much prefer their IPA in a can. D: Moderate drinkability, I had the bomber myself, and didn't want another one. I too was excited to see a Caldera in a bottle, but after tasting it I much prefer their IPA or Pale Ale in a can.","1897: I got this one from SuperNova777 in my poker winnings. Thanks a lot bud. Poured a great copper color with quite a bit of big white head on it. Decent lacing as well. Smell is full of citrus and hops. Taste is very good - great hop flavor. Mouthfeel is light-medium. This beer goes down very smooth. Really glad I got a chance to try this beer. I really enjoyed it.","1958: Shared with some friends at a homebrew meeting. A - Pours light golden, 2 fingered head, and dissipates fast. S - Grass, pine, and honey. T - Grass, pine and honey again. M - Bitter, lets you know it's an IPA and it ain't messing around. D - Good, but average Joe would need to appreciate and expect a bitter beer.","1278: Slightly hazed orange-amber with a towering head of persistent, lumpy foam. Sugary citrus zestiness, green pine, and a crackery\u002fdoughy note in the nose. Very smooth hoppy flavor. It doesn't smack you in the face with any sort of brashness, just lovely fresh hops...orange and pine (definitely some Simcoe in there) with a gradualy increasing bitterness that tends to stick to the inside of the mouth. Not particularly \"bright\", it leans more towards the dark and dank side with just the right amount of malty sweetness and a touch of honey. Medium bodied, oily, and bitter. Very nice!","1354: 22 oz bottle from Fred Meyer, N.Salem store. $5.19 Darker than the typical IPA..almost amber beerr with a large thick and frothy cream coloured head. Aroma seems balanced between resiny hop and nice toasty malts. Again the taste is balanced with nice caramell,toasted hops blancing a nice resinous hop bite..lasting after bitterness. Quite nice and thick for style on the palate. Overall i liked this one more than i thought i would.","1705: A: Slightly hazy copper color with a slight off-white head and pretty intense lacing. S: Pine hops and a lot of caramel malts. T: Pretty fair balance between the hops and malts. Nice amount of hops upfront and then a lot of bready malts with a slightly burnt flavor to them. Crisp and pretty easy to drink. Without a doubt the best IPA I've ever had from a can.","1887: #BeforeTheFlood Watch #BeforeTheFlood right here, as @LeoDiCaprio travels the world to tackle climate change... https:\u002f\u002ft.co\u002fHCIZrPUhLF","3: @Sluttela not this year apparently, global warming kill us all","20: RT @GlblCtzn: Here\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s what you need to know about Leonardo DiCaprio\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s climate change film. https:\u002f\u002ft.co\u002fiqsmOmRlTk","32: @AstroKatie You might mention that Hilary Clinton strongly endorses science and believes climate change is real.","62: RT @rabihalameddine: Trump calls global warming a Chinese hoax.

Gold in color. Hazy. Very nice fruity, hoppy smell. Enjoy the grapefruit smell while raising to your nose. Taste was very well balanced for IPA. Hoppy but not out of control. Very nice mouth feel, which makes this a very drinkable beer. White head, with a moderate lacing. This is a good beer. I would describe it as a, \"very drinkable\" beer. Enjoy!","8: Pours a nice copper \u002f amber with a medium tan lasting head and nice lacing. Aroma of earthy piney hops, followed by some caramel malt and nice fruity bouquet. Taste is resiny earthy piney hops with some nice caramel maltiness and light fruity notes. Palate is nice crisp medium body with good carbonation. Finish is sweet caramel malt with some fruitiness ending with a good hoppy bitterness. Overall a seemed a bit on the hoppy side but seems to be well balanced, a good drinkable brew.","10: A: poured a caramel brown with a thin head that left a little bit of sticky lacing on the glass. S: at first I get caramel aromas with a underlying floral hop notes which had a good malt presence. There was also some citrus and bready notes as well. T: some nice piney hops pop out on the taste with caramel and citrus grapefruit accents that help out on the bitterness. It seems to have a decent malt backbone that helps out the balance. M: medium body with a low amount of carbonation that still works out but had a slight sweet and bitter hop finish. D: pretty good IPA that drank well and had a good amount of sweetness but lacked on the hop punch. It was still a tasty brew.","39: A can picked up in Baltimore. Pours a clear amber color with lots of foamy off-white head. Good retention leaves some spotty lacing. Smells of grassy hops, bread, caramel, and earth. Tastes of bread, toasted grains, caramel, lite citrus, and an earthy and grassy finish. Medium in body with good carbonation. Clean and smooth, malty and grainy with a nice bitter finish. Refreshing and easy to drink, a nice canned amber ale that I would definitely enjoy while out and about in the Summer time.","43: Had this on 2011-09-23 in Lynchburg, VA A - Almost clear, orange-amber with a 2-finger off-white head with big bubbles and moderate lacing. S - Fairly strong aroma that can be smelled 18\" away. Sweet malt, citrus and hop floral. T - Much like the aroma. Sweet bread and fruit followed by a dash of orange flesh a touch of spice and finally orange rind bitterness doesn't dominate. A pleasant, well-balanced bitter-sweet taste although it doesn't blow my hair back. M - Medium body and carbonation. A bit syrupy with some prickle O - I enjoyed this brew. It has a lot of flavor for being 6.1% ABV.","57: Again folks, I do enjoy a fruit beer every now and then, and this was a pretty decent brew, just not a stand out. A - pours an average reddish gold hue with light carbonation and a thin head S - Actually nice on the nose, delicate perfume with ginger, honey, and flowers up front. T - Pretty good, though nothing special, kind of girly, but would be nice to drink at the pool or beach M - light bodied and lacks stuffing, lots of acidity up front D - gets rather boring and a little too tedious after the first few sips.","61: From the can at SAVOR 2011. Pours a clear golden color with an average white head and a slight amount of white lacing on the way down. The nose brings quite a bit of citrus hop character, mostly tending toward grapefruit. Quite nice. The flavor has just a touch of malt in the background and is instead focused on a fairly-heavy hop presence. Orange and grapefruit come through and perhaps a bit of a floral character. Medium body with good bitterness. Nice and dry. Solid brew.","64: Can. Great for shooting empty bottles in the desert. Orange color. Yummy dry hop aroma, fruity too. Good taste, not tongue numbing hops or bitterness, just the right amount for an active outdoor lifestyle for this ipa. Right amount of sweetness. Not heavy on the palate at all. Good summer ipa. Nothing outlandish mouthfeel wise. $10 a 6 was difficult at first, but seems to be a decent price after all.","67: Pours a reddish orange with a thick off-white head. Lots of sticky lacing, head reduces down to nice crust. Smells of pine, grapefruit, and resinous hops. Nice hoppy flavor with citrus and pine notes. I tinge of malt as well. Medium bodied mouth feel and overall a very drinkable beer.","82: From a can an aggressive pour into a chalice. Looks nice. Dark golden clear color with a decent head. Lace layers nicely on the side of the glass. Aroma is very pleasing building anticipation and expectations. The taste isn't quite there however. The citrus is there - to a fault. A little too bitter with an unpleasing aftertaste. It's good, just not quite ready for the big time. With all the great beers Oregon has to offer the competition is too tough to rate this beer among the best. If they smooth out the edges with a little balance this can be a great beer.","88: 12oz can poured into a pint glass Pours a pretty amber-golden with a nice head a very pretty lacing. Smells delicious -- fresh and hoppy, citrus and floral and more hoppy. Taste is some honey up front and floral throughout with a strong hoppy bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, very slightly filmy, very slightly sticky. Very drinkable. Very pleasant. Nice to have a good beer in a can for those occasions where you can't use glass.","102: 12 oz bottle poured into Sam Adams glass. Good head and lacing, pours a deep amber. Aroma is citrus piney hops, with a bit of toffee. Taste has a great hop profile, bitter piney yet plenty of flavorful citrus fruit as well. Dry finish, medium viscosity. Overall a very nice west coast style IPA.","120: 12 oz. can into duvel tulip glass appearance: looks good ruby\u002forange\u002fstrawlike color with some heavy headiness, definitely dissipating though, doesnt look too carbonated smell\u002ftaste: smelling some fruitiness and some hops also and some malty balanced undertones. the taste is hoppy and not overbearing, kind of not full bodied enough. a different one this is mf: not really slick or thick just a runny ipa drink: could drink a few my first offering from caldera, ill have to try some more flavors","121: A - Pours a clear light yellow with 3 fingers foamy white head. Lots of carbonation bubbles. S - Very nice malt aroma with floral and citrus hop aromas mixing nicely. T - Taste follows the smell with floral, citrus hop notes, mild bitterness, very rich caramel malt base. M - Light bodied, lots of carbonation, finish is all bittering hops. D - Good drinkability, very smooth and the flavors work well together.","144: Appearance. Slightly hazy, deep amber with a two finger, off-white head. Smell. Lemon and orange rinds with a little herbal earthyness Taste. Bitter pink grapefruit with a good hit of caramel malt, A little acrid on the tongue but turns into a nice bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel. Medium-strong carbonation. A little thin and a little warm alcohol. Drinkability. A good drinker. Seems a bit acidic, but a good long hoppy finish keeps me gulping this one down.","147: Pours a really nice sunburnt orange. Subtle head is off white and minimal. Aroma - Lots of citrus, and tangy aromas, a little bit of dankness. I get clementine and tangerine, apricot, and a little peach. Flavor - solid bitterness with a crisp hop flavor. I get a good earthy flavor with a nice caramel note in the backround. Good malt backbone with biscuit and cracker dry notes. Overall- good everyday drinker IPA. Lots of hop goodness with a solid malt flavor to back it up.","158: Pours a nice clear golden pale with foamy white head. Smells nice with very apparent herbal hop aroma. Taste is smooth with a nice crackery malt flavor and a big bitter hop finish. A tad overly bitter for your typical pale ale, maybe needs a bit more malt but I still like it. Plus it comes in a can which is a GREAT thing. Go cans.","188: The beer pours a nice gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a solid pale malt scent with some bisquity notes and a mild citrus hop aroma. There is a creamy\u002fbready character to it. The taste is good as well. It has a good hop bite up front along with a balance of pale and bisquit malts. It's quite a hoppy APA. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinking pale ale. It's crisp and bitter and very enjoyable.","196: Poured a very pale yellow. No head whatsoever. Some bready aroma, but very light. Very faint lemony flavor. Extremely light malt flavors that finished with a distinct light beer aftertaste. This beer shoud've been labeled as a light beer. Shame on me for buying a lager with an ABV less than 4. Almost any mass produced light beer is better than this one. I even drank it after mowing my lawn. Should've had a tall glass of water.","242: Big thanks to G311 for this one. A - Nice big IPA appearance: deep amber with a rich head, though lesser retention and lace. S - Really a very muted nose. It is nearly astoundingly so. T - The taste is quite a bit more, well, existent... because there is really nothing but a ghost of and IPA there in the aroma dept. A bit floral and grassy, and some caramel; tastes good, just not exceptional. M - IPA. A little flaccid. D - Doesn't measure up to the Red Racer IPA that preceded it (not that it was world-class, either). Probably not even as good as the regular Caldera IPA.","254: Pour was a surprisingly murky yet bright caramel color with an aggressive, sticky head. Big hops flavor up front - broadly bitter with floral and herbal notes, finishing up with a bit of pine resin. Substantial malt flavor, leaning toward caramel malt and a bit of toffee. Mouthfeel was almost chewy - no one will accuse this beer of being overly filtered.","259: The first one poured with an incredibly large off white head with great retention. I was very careful the second time. Color was a hazy copper Smelled of bubble gum and citrus. Tastes like it smells, with a hint of lime. The grapefruit biterness kicks in at the end. Well carbonated, smooth, nicely balanced between malt and hops. A fine example of an American IPA. Highly recommended.","272: Poured into a 1\u002f2 liter stein a deep rich amber\u002fbronze with a fluffy one finger head that took its time fading.Sweet smoke,brown,sugar,a bit of alcohol in the nose,mellow and sweetish,I found it appetizing.Cherry wood sweetness and light peppery spice in the nose,its gentle sweet smoke instead of in your face,mellow but assertive enough.A real nice smoked bock beer,I will grab a few of these this fall while eating alot of smoked meat off my smoker.","281: Received this can through Beer Powerball. I am really sorry that I don't know who sent it, my brother is keeping those records, but THANK YOU!! Pours with a nice half centimeter white fluffy head on a glass of dark straw-colored beer. Smells of citrusy hoppy goodness and oddly, a little like soap. Mouthfeel is very pleasant as is taste. This is a nice drinking beer. It's not blow you away with over-the-top flavor. It's a well-balanced, highly drinkable and enjoyable brew. I'm glad to have gotten the chance to try it.","296: Appears a dark orange color with a large amount of white foam. It smells slightly of caramel, citrus and grassy hops. The smell is very well balanced you can smell both malts and hops. It tastes initially of semisweet malts the malty taste quickly goes away. A profound and flavorful hop bitterness soon follows. There is a nice citrus flavor and also a nice fruity sweetness. Overall a very solid IPA. The carbonation is moderate low. This is quite drinkable; I could drink a few of these in a row easy. An excellent IPA that is hoppy yet is balanced perfectly with semisweet malt.","305: Poured from a 12 oz can to a pint glass the liquid is yellow with good carbonation. The head is almost 2 fingers white and leaves good lace. The smell is real nice sweet piney and citrus notes. The taste follows, piney citrus notes, and a bready malt that is quite good. The mouthfeel is also nice, crisp and clean, smooth and a good body, the carbonation is real good. The drinkability is good, a easy drinking brew, wroth a try. Prosit, MK","323: Cloudy, brownish amber. Medium, foamy, off-white head. Some carbonation and a touch of lacing. Earthy, floral hop aroma, some bready malts. Flavor has more earthy hops, lots of bready, grainy malt. Heavy-ish body but not sweet. A nutty aftertaste. Odd for a west coast IPA; not hoppy at all but not much malt flavor or complexity going on either.","324: Pours an opaque black with a 3 inch puffy khaki head that settles to a small cap. A nice latticework of lacing forms on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, dark chocolate, and alcohol. Taste is of dark roasted malt, coffee beans, and cocoa powder. A mild roasty bitterness sticks around after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp but smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good RIS with a nice balance of aromas and flavors. This one took me by surprise.","327: Served from can into a Delerium Tremens tulip. Pours a hazy red-orange with a one finger off-white head that slowly subsides to minimal. Maintains decent lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt, hops, and pine. The flavor was of malt and a load of hops. It was medium on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a very nice IPA from a can no-less. Definitely worth seeking out if you are an IPA fan as it is quite drinkable and enjoyable. I will be having another in the near future.","388: Poured from a can into my snifter. A - A clear golden orange, slightly burnt red color body with a medium frothy light white head. S - Very nice and big citrus hop smell that is smooth and sweet. Very pleasant. T & M & D - Great fruit sweetness up front that is refreshing and almost minty cool. Then some bigger malty sweetness on mid palate and the slight fruit acidity cleans the end and brings in some slight airy floral notes. The mouth is light and very drinkable, I go back to refreshing. O - Awesome IPA and I love the can. They really pull of the style well. One of my favorites that I come back to often. -Cheers","404: 22 oz bomber. Slight aroma of bread, light whiffs of cheese for some reason. Ugly looking beer..insipid pee colour..least the small white head hangs around. Taste papery, bread, some lemongrass. Really very little to it Macro-lager palate to it..average. Overall pretty bad stuff here.' Get a 40 of MHL or PBR save you money.","409: 12 oz. can tried 20 Jul 2009. Poured in the 0.5 L Adambrau becker. Extra large fizzy beige head. Light carbonation. Faintly hazy golden orange color. Citric and buttery toffee aroma. Grapefruit pithiness to start and throughout. Moderate caramel and toastiness. Somewhat buttery (A is ok with that in an IPA). Bittersweet lingering aftertaste. Moderate ethnanol. Medium body. Just don't like the butteriness in IPAs...","440: Poured from the can into a tulip. Nice pour, perfect carbonation, nice medium head, solid lacing. Aroma is a perfect IPA balance of malt and citrusy piney hops. Taste matches aroma perfectly, this is a very balanced IPA. One weakness for me is the mouthfeel is the slightest bit thin. For all the flavor and aroma I would like it a bit \"chewier\". Very solid IPA.","446: A-Gold-light bronze. Big eggshell head. Brilliantly clear. S-Piney, citrusy hops. Crackers. Slight soapiness after a while. T-citrus rinds, some pine. Firm bitterness. Bitterness hides much of the malt but some crackery malt comes through. M-medium light bodied. Medium carbonation. No alcohol burn. really nice. D-Really nice beer. A bit on the bitter side to drink all night but a really tasty beer.","483: Pours a very pale straw yello color with frothy white head, quickly dicipating but decent lacing. Smell is dominated by piney, earthy hops with a presence of citrus and floral. Pale straw like malts. Taste is a mirror of these scents, not much complexity, but good. Medium bodied, adequate carbonation. Definitely a refreshing, milder alternative to many pale ales currently out there.","486: Apperance: Orange-y, light amber. Lacing left on the glass. Smell: Nice citrus hop aroma thats pretty minimal of a NW IPA, a nice chance. Taste: Malt flavor is rapidly replaced with a pretty bitter lasting hop finish. T Mouthfeel: darn easy drink.... Drinkability: Tasty beer, Id drink this again.","488: The beer pours a hazy dark golden\u002famber color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pale and Carapils scent along with a huge citrus hop aroma. There is a light breadiness as well. The taste is very good. It's light with a damn bitter hop taste. It's loaded with citrus goodness. The malt bill provides some balance, but this is a hop heavy beer. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great session IPA. It refreshingly hoppy and easily drinkable.","491: Super clear orange body with a frothy sticky head that lasts the whole beer, very impressive appearance. Smells sweet, pine, citrus, biscuity, earthy. Taste is very malty with very little bitterness which i was not expecting as this is an IPA and should have more hop profile the taste. A little too malty for my liking.","545: Pours a clear orange with a big tan head. Smells of citrus. Taste is very citrusy up front, with a nice caramel malt middle, and an herbal, smoky hop finish. Nice bitterness that clings to your tongue. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, nice low carbonation. Drinkability is great, several of these in a row wouldnt be difficult. A super choice for an IPA which conveniently comes in a can.","558: Thanks to Kegatron for hooking me up with a can. Pours a clear amber color with 3 fingers of tall foamy off-white head. Great retention leaves lots of lacing stick. Smells of caramel, pine, grapefruit, and spicy hops. Tastes of toasted grains, caramel, citrus fruits, and bitter spicy and earthy hops in the finish. Medium in body with good carbonation. Crisp and balanced with a nice woodsy bitter finish. Easy to drink and enjoyable. A solid sessionable IPA that has me looking forward to trying more stuff from Caldera.","586: Pours out a little thin looking weak ice tea color with two fingers of slightly off-white suds and lots of lacing. Smell is strong citrus and grapefruit rind. This is a great smelling beer. Taste is piney and grapefruity with slight sugar. Mouthfeel is very clean for such a big hop brew. Not sticky at all. Very quaffable. Overall I would have to give this a 4 even though it's really in the 4.12 range. Only reason not to give it a 4.5 is the cost of this stuff. 16 dollars in Ky.","594: Thanks to flexabull for this in the UGLY BIF. Gotta love craft canned beers. Pours a pale yellow color, slight opaqueness, good sized head with a little retention layer and a little bit of lacing. Smell is stronger than I would expect from a pale ale, strong citrus and grapefruit aroma with hops, makes me think it could almost be an IPA if some more hops were added. Taste hits with the hops and citrus first, leaves an interesting bitterness in the mouth, not quite good but not quite bad, carbonation is just right and it goes down crisp and smooth, I could see this being an easily sessionable brew if it was available in Maine.","608: Poured into pint glass. A - reminiscent of a pilsner more than an APA, 2 fingers of white head, head lasted a while, just kinda floated there S - light hints of citrus, mostly grapefruit and lemon, maybe a little bready T - hop blast, pretty bitter and dry, follows the smell closely M - good carbonation, good body for the style, not too light and certainly not heavy D - great for a canned beer, cant beat the portability and taste, just started to get the caldera brews in my local beer store, will continue to try new ones","616: Pours dark nice amberish color head. Smell is hoppy piney goodness Taste is hoppy (of course) I detected a tiny hint of citrus with followed by a nice grassy piney after taste. went down smooth and a wee bit creamy great beer to start the night out with. all and all typical Hopped out beer, but price VS quality one of the best out there.","618: Pours a nice clear and bright amber color with a decent head, and a bit of lacing. Aromas are pine like, earthy, pungent and resiny. Smells a bit funky, but not bad. Taste is crisp, biting, with some sharp brewed tea flavors up front. Hint of hard candy sweetness, and light creamy malt flavors. Finish is bitter, earthy, grassy, and dry. Mouthfeel is very good. Very full, smooth, and nicely carbonated. Overall, an interesting and tasty beer. A but different than most IPAs brewed on the West Coast, unique, and rough around the edges, but I like it.","620: Pours golden with 1 finger of eggshell white head. good head retention & lacing S: Slight lemony & grassy hop notes, plus a bit of breadyness T: Lemony & grapefruitty hops; plus a bit of honey malt up front. Some grainyness & grapefruit hops as this warms. Finishes crisp with a load of grapefruit MF: Light\u002f medium bodied with lively carbonation that really show cases the hops, for better or worse. Skews too hoppy, makes me think IPA more than APA Drinks pretty easy despite the OTT hoppyness.. still a solid APA","621: Appearance: Golden amber with the slightest haze and a nice sticky two finger head. Smell: Lots of signature cascade aroma - citrusy with a touch of pine. Taste & mouthfeel: Juicy citrus hop flavors supported by a dry biscuity malt backbone. Medium-light in body, crisp, dry. Moderate bitterness in the finish, though it doesn't linger too long. Very clean stuff, and incredibly drinkable. This reminds me quite a bit of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, but more raw and flavorful.","633: A: Pours a clear golden color, not too much head or lacing down the glass S: Grassy\u002fpiney type hop scent, nothing too fragrant though T: Mild sweetness followed by a nice crisp grassy\u002fherbal hop flavor M: Light to medium bodied, carbonation is pretty good O: This is a nice summer BBQ beer, I think i may like their amber better but this one is a decent pale.","649: A-Full bronze. big light tan head. brilliantly clear. S-Some toasty malt. Light citrus hop aroma. Not a lot going on. T-Carmelly malty. Firm bitterness but more balanced to the malt than their Pale ale. Not much in the way of hop flavor. Lots of bitterness but not much flavor. M-medium bodied. medium carbonation. No alcohol burn. D-An average tasting IPA. Needs more hop flavor and aroma. Bitterness and malt are spot on. Still not a bad beer.","660: Can from Beerzack. Thanks! Pours Semi-clear reddish amber witha big lasting chunky whitish head that leaves lots of lacing. Smell is sweet fruity, fresh and hoppy. Very nice. Taste is smooth with fruity caramel and fresh citrusy, and sweet orange flavored hops and bitter citrus rind. Nice and strongly bittered which lasts in the finish but with a light lingering sweetness too. Very good IPA.","661: Nice amber color with a great head and lacing, plus it's in a can! Love it when beers are in cans. It smells piney and earthy and gains in the taste. Earthy Munich malts balance with a lot of citrusy and herbal northwestern hops, with some metallic and peppery notes sneaking in to make a solid but not outstanding IPA. Slight stickiness to the mouthfeel, but very drinkable overall.","683: No Canned on Date A - Pours a rich amber color. Completely clear, with minimal head. S - Sweet hoppy syrupy smells. Hints of piney resin. T - Piney, resin, floral hops. No noticeable citrus qualities. Finishes very dry and bitter. M - Medium body with moderate to high carbonation. Just right for an IPA. D - Nothing I would go out of my to get again, but nothing I'd turn down either. This is a solid IPA. Not a lot to rant about, both positive and negative. The flavors are pretty one dimensional, bitter piney hops, no citrus undertones that I enjoy so much.","690: Can recieved in a recent trade as en extra. A: Decent head, takes a minute or so to settle down. Very clear light orange colored beer. Some lacing. S: Fruity scents with not too much hops present in the nose. T: This beer just is not a solid example of the style. Really not much of a hop presence at all. With what I have heard about Caldera 'Old Growth' I was hoping this would be a pleasant surprise. I'd skip this one if I was looking for a solid IPA M: Low to medium carbonation. Slightly oily mouthfeel. O: Move along, nothing to see here.","694: Drank on tap at Old Town Pizza in Portland in pint glass. A: Solid amber hue; lacing in glass. S: Slightly grass smell, hoppy notes on the nose. T & M: This was a quite hoppy pale ale but not overly so, this is a nicely done pale ale. D: Highly drinkable, this is a pale ale that could definitely be sessionable. I really enjoyed this beer but get a feeling that I'll have a hard time finding this in Dallas.","718: A - Poured out a clear, orange color with gold highlights. It had a foamy, fizzy, one-finger layer of white foam that left minimal lacing. S - It had a moderately grassy aroma with notes of orange. It also had a gentle caramel scent. T - It tastes of bitter grassy hops with a snappy, spice flavor. The ale also had a burnt toast maltiness. M - It was sharp and lively on the tongue. A light bodied pale ale. D - This is a pleasant tasting pale ale. It's nice to have a sessionable ale in a can.","722: Nice dark orange colured ale, small lightv tan head. I dont like the aroma, it certainlly has hops aplenty, but has a sour ,sweaty work sock aroma that puts me off in the background. The flavor is better, very strong oniony hopping, pink grapefruit and spruce tips. Thin and maybe even a tad under carbonated. I dint really dig this one. I liked their Pale Ale way better.","730: A: Poured from a can to a pint glass. Had an orangey color and a cloudy texture. There was a half inch of foamy, long-lasting head and very good lacing. S: A nice aroma of citrus, hops, and a slight maltiness. T: Tasted of hops, pine, citrus, and some caramel malt. A very Western-type flavor for an IPA. M: A well-carbonated beer with a dry, crisp finish. Medium-bodied. D: A very drinkable beer that helps to dispell the myth that only bad beers come in cans.","741: I got this beer from Tilley4. Thanks Jason! 12oz can served in a standard pint glass. L - slightly hazed copper color with a bone white head that left trails of lacing. S - citrus rind and a slab of butter rolled in dirt. T - bitter citrus rind upfront with some buttery notes before getting dry and tart on the finish. F - medium bodied with a biting feel and smooth carbonation. D - goes down quick and easy.","747: A - Pours a nice amber color with a average cream head with some lacing. S - Nice Pine and Grapefruit hops but also some sweet malt on the end. T - Flavor was thinner than some IPA's but still nice with the Pine and Citrus, nice malt finish. M - Nice IPA medium body with a average carbonation. Smooth feel. D - Pretty Good. The best canned IPA I have had so far. I am sure it will be great this coming summer on a canoe trip. Like the can, easy to carry.","748: Appearance: orange-copper, good clarity, spongey layer of yellowy foam that collapses to a thin cap Aroma: luscious, billowy bouquet of caramelly malt, cooked strawberries, and woodsy hops Flavor: medium-sweet malt backbone with a biscuity\u002fcaramelly note; scrunchy, grassy hop flavor with a mellow bitterness; finishes semisweet with a fresh-hop aftertaste Mouthfeel: medium-full body, gentle carbonation, smooth Other: Small batch? Do some bigger ones of this bad boy!","766: Pours amber, bordering on orange. Completely white, fluffy head. Pine sap and floral bouquet for aroma. Malt sweetness is also detectable in the nose. Taste is grassy, piny, spicy. Assertive but balanced, caramel malt is present. Big merit on drinkability, a simple and flavorful IPA. Finishes clean, nice and smooth. This would be a great \"every day\" IPA, but I guess, so would Pliny.","769: Pours out a clear, amber\u002forange with a 2-finger, thick, white head that leaves moderate, splotchy lacing. The smell is both fruity and malty, malt dominates. Taste is fruity, citrus hops up front then overtaken by a strong malt flavor and finishes with bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium, well-carbonated at first but low later. Drinkability is fine. I like it and many of those who like IPAs will also.","772: A: hazy pale orange. very fluffy white head. reasonable retention with better lacing. S: earthy, mellow hoppiness. bitterness dominates the aroma with a slight fruitiness. as it warms up, actually a nice sweet malt comes into play as well. T: slick, slightly metallic, hop bitterness. slightly doughy. more biscuit, dry finish. M: tingly carbonation on a medium body. D: sort of shocking that i have an APA from the west coast that isn't a hop bomb. not sure how i feel about that.","777: Poured from the can a slightly-hazed amber gold with a huge frothy off-white head. Juicy aroma of grapefruit and pine hops and sweet, bready malts. Hoppy bitterness upfront with the grapefruit and pine. Sweet malts and caramel offer a good balance. Lighter bodied, crisp and dry, with a moderate carbonation. A super sessionable and flavorful IPA from Caldera. A bit steep at $12 a sixer, but then again, I'd much rather have one of these outdoors than most other options.","778: 12 oz can poured into duvel snifter A - pours a deep amber, very lively, large white head that stays for a bit, very good looking beer S - huge citrus notes, absolutely amazing smelling beer T - amazing citrusy grapefruits and oranges amazing IPA, absolutely, the bitterness is perfectly balanced M - very smooth, creamy, easy to drink O - the best IPA I have ever had, absolutely amazing beer","779: Appearance: Pours a clear, orangey-copper body with a small, bubbly white head. Smell: Aroma of caramel malts with an herbal, citrus hop presence. Taste: Mild caramel malt flavor and sweetness. Zesty citrus hops and the taste of fresh herbs. A pinch more of those caramel malts reemerge for the overall bitter finish. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Slight stickiness to the mouthfeel. Drinkability: Whaddya know, it's a fairly good IPA.","783: Poured from the can into a glass tumbler. Nice aroma and pale yellow appearance. Nice fluffy head and fair amount of lacing. Taste was a big surprise, I thought any beer from a can would be a let-down. The initial malt sweetness was nicely balanced by the hop bitterness. Not like an IPA for sure but impressive anyway. Mouthfeel was O.K. and drinkability was good. Made with whole flower Cascade hops.","808: It has a dark bronze and amber body. The head and lace are full, rocky and tan. The aroma is sweet but there is some yeast spice and little floral accents. It reminds me of a pale ale flavor a bit bitter, grapefruit like but has a sweet melon finish. The mouthfeel is medium. The carbonation had a lot of staying power.","812: Pours a hazy orangish amber with 1\u002f4\" of dense, foamy, white head that has great retention. The nose has notes of bready malt, pineapple, and grapefruit with a faint flora aroma. The taste is bready and malty up front with a nice blend of hop characters ranging from pineapple, grapefruit-citrus, and faint pine. The flavors are very well blended. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, well carbonated, and very refreshing. This is delicious and very easily drinkable. I could put away a lot of these especially since the bitterness from the hops isn't overpowering like in some IPAs so no diminishing returns here.","832: Hazy apricot color with a solid frothy eggshell colored head with great retention and lacing. Visible carb at the edges. Nice floral and grapefruit hop notes on the nose. Good clean flavors. Nice mild hop notes up front with the same characteristics as the nose balanced well with the middle-backended caramel maltiness. Hops create a slightly bitter aftertaste. Mouth is crisp with a bit of a zip and high carb. Overall it's a good pale ale. A perfect beer to have in a can like it is, being a perfect beer to have while camping, golfing, fishing etc.","837: A - Poured out a slightly hazy, auburn\u002famber color with a thick, foamy, tan, two-finger head. It left some nice lace. S - It smelled of tons of pine. Sweet notes of grapefruit and orange peel. T - It was very peppery and spicy with a smooth burnt toast maltiness. Some subtle citrus flavors, too. M - It was crisp and sharp. A light to medium-bodied beer. D - This is a pretty good IPA. Here in the Midwest the price tag was a bit high, though.","839: My first beer from this brew...and what a goodie! Over a finger of off-white head lingers over a translucent amber. The head lives a good amount of sticky lacing all over the glass. Aromas of floral and herbal hops with a sweet but bready maltiness as a distance backbone. Earthy notes in both the aroma and taste. Tons of bitter residuals linger on the palate, thanks in part to a medium mouthfeel. This is a delicious IPA, and I look forward to grabbing more cans from this brewery!","849: Poured from a can into a standard pint glass. Beer is orange and clear. Tight white head forms and when it falls away leaves lacing on the glass. Carbonation is medium. Aroma is good but pretty simple. It is piney hop aroma and not much else, I may detect a little sweetness. It is attractive. Clean drinking beer, good bitterness all at the back finishes nearly completely. I would describe this as well balanced. As you drink it the aftertaste builds on you slightly, still a very drinkable beer. Body is medium, which is fine. I like this IPA.","883: Snagged a can of this after seeing that it's got such a positive amount of reviews. The beer poured out as a clear yellowish gold color, it has a pretty good looking soapy head on it. The lacing is a little sticky but not too much. The smell of the beer has a really nice malty and hoppy aroma. The hops smell bright and fruity. The taste of the beer was pretty good. The hops were definitely in there ready to hit ya in the mouth. The malt cleaned up the mess in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was light and refreshing. Overall it was a pretty good IPA.","891: A - pours an amber color with a two finder head that is retained for a good 5-10 minutes. The beer is almost as clear as a lager...not cloudy at all. S - very strong citrus smells. T - similar to the smells, the first predominant taste is citrusy. After that, you get a hint of caramel. Then the hops come through and leave a nice bitterness finish. D - I love this IPA. It's one of my favorites! It's exactly how a west coast IPA should taste. The only issue could be a slight lack in carbonation.... But I find that true of most craft can beer I try.","901: Pours a nice golden peach color with a frothy long lasting ivory head. Smells of earthy grassy hops and a little citrus. Great tasting with plenty of bitterness and some grapefruit. Just enough of a malt backbone to let those grassy hops shine. A medium-bodied and flavorful IPA available in a can that reminded me of a nicer version of 60 min. If the price point were lower, I'd drink this a ton.","923: This is indeed quite tasty. The jet black color is very nice not very much light getting through this beer. The head is sticky and light brown. The hops are prominent along with a ton of roasted chocolate flavors and wood in the aroma and taste. The mouthfeel is semi thick, a little oily. The beer overall is really nice.","932: A - hazey orange in color with a rocky white head which quickly dissipates to a thin film. S - the nose is rich with hops. piney and fruity. sweet caramel malt notes and some cherry esters. T - clean, lightly sweet malt upfront followed by some piney bitterness and a long cherry\u002fsweetish finish. M - smooth, creamy, a touch watery and a full zippy carbonation. O - nice IPA with lots of piney notes but could've had a bit more bitterness on the tongue.","976: 12 oz. can with a slightly different look from the one shown above. No freshness date Poured a bright, clear orange with a half-inch white head. Very subdued fruity aromas which quickly fade. This is the least impressive character of this ale. The ale begins with a pleasant bitterness that lingers on the tongue. There is a very faint metallic flavor that quickly faded. Overall, this is dry and refreshing. Noticeably carbonated with a light body. The mouthfeel is clean and refreshing. While not very complex, this is a summer quaffer with its light, refreshing body and slight fruity bitterness.","981: 22oz bottle into snifter. 2011 vintage. from notes. Pours black with a thick mocha colored head that dissipates fairly quickly. The aroma is of cocoa, with roasty malts. I can just barely pick up notes of the licorice. The taste follows the nose fairly well. Cocoa mixed with astringent coffee, though the licorice is more pronounced then in the aroma. The mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied with subtle carbonation. This was quite drinkable, and left me a very good impression of the brewery.","984: Pours a very nice golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice creamy one-finger plus off-white head, lots of nice small islands and sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, big hop note, citrus\u002fpines, and caramel. The taste is very nice, malty, hoppy, with some nice citrus\u002fpine tones, with some caramel thrown in. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very solid IPA (in a can too), definitely recommended.","989: a: This was a very pale, clear golden color. It was served to me with craggy, sticky head that stuck around for awhile. s: Big piney hop nose with a little lemon. t: This tasted very fresh. Sweet flavors of toffee and then a big piny hop blast at the end. m: Fabulous carbonation, long lasting. Perfect. d: One of the best IPAs I've tried. Great stuff.","991: appearance: Wow very active beer with a haze through it. The white lace does stay on top forever it felt like. Smell: Hoppy with needles. It really is a classic lager smell Taste: Clean with off flavor on the back end that I just can't put my finger on it. someone help me with it.... mouthfeel is bad. It burns there is so much carbonation. I just can't do it. It honestly sent my taste-buds into shock on the first drink there was so much activity on my tongue. I found myself wanting to rank it higher but it just wasn't there to get the higher rating.","995: 12 oz. can, A: Pours amber, nice finger sized white head, good head retention, solid lace, nice look all around. S: Oranges\u002fSimcoe, tropical fruit, pine, a very pretty smell, but understated, could be great. T: Heavy citrus dominates - orange, tangerine, grapefruit, pine in the finish. Like the Pale, the malt is very light, I like the hop profile a lot more in this one as compared to the Pale. M: Soft carbonation - perhaps from the can, medium-bodied. D: Pretty standard Northwest IPA, a fine drinking beer, not going to wow you.","1000: Reviewed on 1\u002f3\u002f2010. Can. Pours a clear deep orange with a thick off-white head. Aroma of piney, grassy hops, some citrus and tropical fruits. Flavor of caramel malt and light citrus upfront with a bitter hops finish. Decent IPA, rather on the bitter side.","1002: Pours a clear burned orange with a creamy head that dies somewhat quickly and little to no lacing. Smells like a hop bomb with strong citrus, rind and a tiny bit of floral. Blows away your taste buds with hops and a bite of citrus. The balance isnt as great as it could be but this sure is tasty, especially if you are a hop head. Finishes wonderfully dry and bitter but doesnt linger too long on the tongue. Carbonation is perfect. A very drinkable and delicious IPA....and from a can no less.","1004: A - Poured a copper color with a big off white head that leaves a ton of lacing behind S - Is a nose full of hops that are both citrus and piney with a touch of caramel malt kicking around T - Follows the nose hops upfront more pine than citrus with the caramel malt trying to come through to add some balance M - This beer has a medium body with higher carbonation to it D - I'm enjoying this IPA quite a bit I don't know if it coming from a can is making me like it more but this beer tastes good and is worth a try if you see it around","1009: Pours a clear gold color, with a big impressive white head. Nice hoppy cascade nose. Floral, and pine like. Beer has a pretty light quality. But is still tasty. Light crisp hop flavor, a bit of malty sweetness and creaminess, and a slightly piney and resiny hop finish. Nice simple APA. Mouthfeel is pretty good. As mentioned, it's a bit light, but still feels nice in the mouth. Drinkability is very good. Light and easy drinking, yet still a tasty APA. Session worthy. I love canned craft beer!","1019: This beer poured out as a nice golden color, almost copper. The head was fluffy and white, left behind a strong lacing too. The smell of the beer was floral and citrusy. The taste of the beer has a sweet bitterness, plenty of citrusy grapefruit flavors and a touch of malt in the back end. The mouthfeel has a good bite to it, with a dry aftertaste. Overall it's a good IPA, I am glad I tried it for sure.","1031: Tapped this open and a fruity piney smell, Cloudy golden orange color when poured in a pint glass. Nice foaming thick head. Big and hoppy, yet smooth as butter. Minimal hop after taste (I like this, so was a liittle disappointed with the lack there of there) However, a delicious beer. Would drink it anytime!! I bet on draft it is a delight!","1035: Serving type- 12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass. A- Pours a pretty deep orange color with a nice lacing. S- Huge notes of citrus: grapefruit and orange. T- A good tasting IPA. Nice even bitter hoppy flavor throughout. Can't taste any alcohol which makes for an easy drinking beer. This is a good West Coast IPA but it is lacking a little when compared with other beers of the same style and region.","1064: Poured into tulip glass. Appearance: Deep mahogany with red hue, pours 1 finger of off-white head that fades quickly. Lots of lacing. Smell: Roasted malt, chocolate, orange zest, slightly boozy as it warms, raw sugars. Taste: roasted malt, chocolate, blood orange, sweet, brown sugar. Mouthfeel: full bodied, good carbonation. Overall: A tasty porter. I like the subtle blood orange element. Not a lot going on here, but what there is is quite good. Drinkability is above average.","1072: Can from K&L Redwood City. A - Pours a bright medium amber color with a two-finger, lasting off-white head and good lacing. S - Aroma is piney and citrusy hops, a touch of sweet malt, and tropical fruits. T - Flavor is a little pale and caramel malt, but mostly showcases a complex hop profile, with pine, pineapple, orange, and grapefruit. Pretty harshly bitter, although I like that of course. M - Crisp palate with medium body and carbonation. D - Solid. Overall this is the best canned IPA I've had after Surly Furious.","1073: Thanks to 5000 for sending this can my way. The beer pours a dark amber color with a white head. Darker than expected. The aroma is very nice. I get a lot of grapefruit and pine notes. The flavor is similar. The predominant flavor is some resiny pine from the hops but I also get some grapefruit. The toffee and caramel malt backbone balance out the beer nicely and keep the bitterness level fairly low for a west coast IPA. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very nice.","1111: Bomber pours a clear straw yellow body with a small vanilla head that quickly drops into some scattered lacing. Aroma has some crackery malt and a hint of floral hops. Mouthfeel is light bodied with a spritzy carbonation. Taste is dominated by a crackery pilsner type maltiness that is balanced by a dry grassy and floral hoppiness. Reminds me of kolsch. Unpretentious and unoffensive. A decent lawn mower beer, I suppose.","1121: A- Aggressive pour yields a three inch off white head. Beer itself is a somewhat cloudy dull light orange. Awesome head retention with above average lacing. S- Bright citrus notes...think lemons, oranges. T- Follows the nose. With a noticeable, but not overpowering, dose of hops on the back end. Well balanced. Alcoholic orange juice, mmmph. M- Medium mouthfeel. Carbonation is lacking a bit it seems. D\u002fO- One of the better pale ales I've had in awhile. Drinkability is the tits...and in cans no less! First Caldera offering is a winner in my book.","1126: Poured from a can into a pint glass A - Amber in color with a thick, off-white head. S - Not as much hop aroma as I had hoped. There is some citrusy hop aroma and a bit of stickiness to it. T - better hop character in the taste. Good malt backbone to balance the hops. The finish is a bit chalky and biscuity. M - The biscuitiness interferes with the mouthfeel to me. A bit too thick on the tongue for an IPA. D - Nothing unpleasant about the way this one goes down. Alcohol is well masked and the carbonation level is right where it needs to be.","1136: A- Pours a nice amber color with a whit head. S- Hops with a citrus tone hint of malt. T- Hops and citrus tones with a hint of a malt finish. M- Semi dry with hop flavors through out sip and a malt finish. D- Pretty good beer from Oregon. I can drink this again with no worries. Cheers...","1137: Appearance: Pale golden pumpkin color with a 2 finger beige creamy head that looks like rocky whipped cream only not as bright white. Good head retention and lacing. Smell: Lots and lots of grapefruit from the hops. Extremely well done. Not overbearing but undeniably grapefruit rind goodness. Taste: Closer to a pale ale with a lot of grapefruit character. Not sure if its chinook hops or cascade that are being used here. Mouthfeel: A bit thin for my liking. Drinkability: Fairly easy to throw these 6.1 ABV cans back.","1150: A: Pours a cloudy orange with a crisp white two finger head layer. S: Slightly citrusy with a bit of hops here, too. T: Malty and hoppy, but neither overpowers. Very well balanced. M: Calm and balanced flavors. D: This would be a great beer for a hot summer day. Nothing wild, but simply a good beer.","1152: A= basic blonde, mild white head, decent lacing. S= honey and floral hops notes. More evident as the beer warmed for a few minutes. T= immediately astringent and dry, somewhat watery, some florals, pine, bitters. M= astringent, some bitterness, florals. D= fine if you like it, depends on the price versus better APA offerings.","1155: A: In a pint glass. Clear amber, nice yellowish head. S: Piney, citrusy hops. Malty, bready, herbal. T: Like smell. Bitter. I like this. MF: Like most beers for me, not remarkable; standard for the style. D: Very drinkable. It's a little pricey and only sold by the can. But if it were cheaper\u002fsold in 6 packs here I'd definitely pick up a sixer.","1162: Poured into a tulip glass. A light golden orange color. Very clear with almost 2 fingers of creamy rich pillowy head. This thing smells like candied hops. Lots of orange citrus covered in caramel. Tastes alot like the aroma only a bit on the lighter side. The citrus is there, the caramel is there and there is also a small amount of floral notes as well. Light to medium bodied with a crisp bitter finish. Overall this is an excellent canned IPA that i could drink all day long. Notes: Review taken from notes written on 5-25-10","1168: A: Poured a pale amber color, clear with good carbonation leaving a nice white head S: Light caramel, hops, bitterness, some citrus and floral notes T: Floral and citrus with impressive hops, def a American West Coast IPA here. M: Lighter bodied with hop bitterness leaving a crisp, bitterness D: Good. I actually thought this could have been a modest single IPA as well","1179: Pours a clear very light yellow with strong carbonation but a weak head. The aroma is sweet, non-descript malt with just a touch of grassy hops and some graininess. The flavor is quite similar with pale malt sweetness, some grassy herbal hops, clean yeast, grainy notes and a surprising amount of bitterness. I have to say that the flavor is pretty disappointing, even for this style, though the dryness does give it some merit. Mouthfeel is not just light, but watery. It has a nice dry finish and is very quaffable, and holds up alright when compared to other beers in this category, but I think there are better options.","1183: A: Deep apricot hue with a huge, beautiful, sudsy cream-colored head; lacing is great S: Lots of wonderful citrus from the hops: peach, mango, pineapple, lemon, grapefruit, and tea leaves with a slightly grassy and grainy malt undertone T: Hops are a touch more muted than aromas indicated but still plenty of citrus, tea leaves, pine, and weed F: Quite creamy upfront and finishing pretty well--though a touch thin O: A nice hop-forward IPA in a can, which you can never get enough of; something I'd like to try even fresher and something I will definitely come back to","1199: A: An amazingly clear, golden pour from can into glass with a fluffy white head that sits on top. S: Just as a pale ale should be: a refreshing citrus aroma with a mild pine to let you know that it still means business. T: Again, a perfect example of a pale ale. A nice clean, refreshing citrus flavor followed by a nice bitter bite on the finish. M: The beer is light and moderately carbonated, but still has a fairly substantial feel on the tongue. D: This must be what Bud is talking about. These guys sure know how to make a great session pale and IPA. I'm glad to see these beers become more easy to come by in CA.","1215: Poured from a 12 oz can into a pint glass. Pours a hazy copper color, with a very small head. Not much lacing. The aroma is very hop forward, notes of citrus. Everything good about the nose gets ramped up a notch in the taste. Huge grapefruit and orange flavors, good malt backbone and a really nice hop finish. Medium bodied, carbonation is good. An incredibly drinkable IPA, will definately seek out again!","1231: Pours golden with a medium sized white foam. Retention is okay, but lacing sticks well. Aroma is bready, somewhat malty, and hoppy. Piney and citrusy. Bready, biscuity, malty with a hop character in the finish. The breadyness makes this almost \"buttery\" in texture. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium and creamy. Carbonation is okay. Drinkability is rather high...lower ABV, great mouthfeel, good taste.","1238: This beer pours a dark amber color, with a perfect size head that did dispate quickly. The smell is strongly of malts, and a smokyness. The taste starts off very malty, smoked flavors, then finishs with a smoked sausage like flavor. The aftertaste is strongly of a smoked meat; and the flavor stays on your palette for some time, also nicely carbonated. Overall fantastic beer, very odd, but still enjoyable.","1240: A: Pours to a frothey tan head with a deep and beautiful copper body. Excellent lacing. S: Slight, hoppy, piney aroma. T: Citrusy with piney hops. Crisp and not real bitter but it does have a slight bite with lasting flavor. The hops definitely comes through. A nice IPA that doesn't knock you over. Typically what an IPA is suppose to be. M: Lightly carbonated, smooth and thin. Not watery or oily. D: Refreshing and while not a session beer, you can easily enjoy a couple of these without any problems. One of the better canned micro-brews that I have tried.","1255: A - pours a clear orangish rust color with a half inch of sticky white foam S - nice citrus hop aroma of lemon and grapefruit and bready malts T - bready malt backbone with some nice citrus hops and a good hoppy bite in the finish M\u002fD - light bodied with lots of flavor, crisp mouthfeel, i'm definitely going to have more of this one","1260: A - Pours a medium amber color with a 1-2 finger head with some lacing. S - You get hit with the regular Pine and Citrus but also some sweet malt on the back end T - Flavor was thinner than some IPA's but still nice with the Pine and Citrus, almost a little too much malt on the back end for me and not as smooth as I would have hoped. M - Crisp IPA light\u002fmedium body with medium carbonation. D - Pretty Good. The best canned IPA I have had, although it was my first canned IPA. Next time I think I would rather have two Pliny's to a six pack of this.","1261: A: Poured a copperish orange color with good carbonation and a nice white head S: Caramel, bread, pine and light booze T: Taste follows nose pretty well. Balanced, with a good caramel and breadiness, floral and pine notes M: Nice lingering bitterness and sweet, sticky feel D: Good","1268: Canned: unk A: pours honey with near excellent clarity and a finger of off-white foam which falls rather quickly to a solid sheet of the same with strong spotty lacing. S: Some herbal hops, some citric hops, honey, sweet malts, smells a little faded. Nothing special. T: Strong bitterness with some vitamin flavors, a hint of lemon, some sweet malts with a hint of oxidation. M: Medium bodied with moderate carb and dry finish. O: Not a bad beer, tastes a little faded, but is quaffible.","1276: Poured from a 12oz can into a nonic. Thanks to BA redbird. This brew pours a cloudy golden-amber color crested with two fingers of head that retains well and leaves great lacing. The smell is great. Hops, grapefruit, and some caramel malts. A normal IPA nose, but done well. The taste is that of a well-done, well-balanced IPA. The malts and hops are quite harmonious, neither taking over too far. There's some ever present grapefruit here as well. The aftertaste does bring in a great deal of hop resin over malts. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both solid. Just a well-done IPA.","1284: Clear orange-copper, or weak iced-tea in color with fine foamy covering that leaves some nice lace. Nice perfumy cascade-like aroma. Some citrus, pine and floral hops. Assertively hoppy. Lots of woodsy pine and some citrus peel. Kinda astringent bitter finish. Slightly stingy aggressive carbonation does not help the already astringent character of the beer. Pretty drinkable, despite the astringent impression.","1290: Great looking 12oz can poured into pint glass. Pours a golden amber color with tons of frothy head and gobs of lacing on the sides of the glass. Very piney hoppy smell. Taste is a slap in the tongue with pine followed by orange citrus. Amazing hop profile on par with super hopped double\u002fimperial IPA's. Light dry mouthfeel that really dries out your mouth. Great drinkability hindered only by the hop blast that will quickly leave your taste buds dulled. Overall this is an amazing IPA that blows my mind every time I drink it.","1299: Amber with hints of orange with big tan foamy head with good retention and uneven lacing. Big citrus hop aroma. Big bitter grapefruit up frony with good caramel mellowing backbone. Smooth, silky feel with a low carb feel despite the big foamy head. A good overhopped IPA that's pleasant yet slightly one dimensional. Not worth $13.50\u002f6 pack unless you really need a good IPA in a can.","1303: Appearance: Pours a hazy, yellow-orange body with a thin, wispy white head. Smell: Aroma of herbal, citrus hops accompanied by a honey-laden maltiness. Taste: Mild pale malts with a bit of toastiness and a soft honey-like sweetness. Citrus and bitter herbs. Medium bitterness. Finishes dry. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Drinkability: A fair pale ale, but I gotta say I enjoyed the Caldera IPA far, far more.","1304: Poured amber from the can. Nice one inch head with plenty of lacing. Aroma is earthy citrus hops and a bit of sweet malt. Flavor is usual hops citrus and pine in this case. Nice balance of hops and malts with hops dominating. Good mouthfeel not too watery. Amazingly good canned beer! Highly recommended if you enjoy IPA's. Try the APA also.","1325: Clear light copper. Thick offwhite head. Decent retention. Nice tight laces. Pine, floral, citrus, and spicy hop aromas. Rich toasty, mild sweet caramel and a touch of vanilla. Crisp grapefruit, floral, pine, spicy resins. Toasty sweet caramel rolls in. Piney\u002fpeppery bitterness. Smooth, semi-rich medium body. good medium carbonation. Some drying and stickiness. Great canned IPA. Very drinkable and very tasty. Tailgating and camping and grilling favorite.","1327: Pours a clean orange-ish to copper color with a light tan head. In the aroma, faint pine like hops. In the taste, mellow pine hops and a nice malt balance. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry to clean hop aftertaste. More a pale than IPA, but decent nonetheless.","1331: 12oz can poured into a pint Pours a hazy golden color with a fluffy white head. Some nice staying power and spider web lacing. The aroma is musty and earthy with layers of pine and orange. On the palate, this guy is a little more pine and citrus forward while the earthy, musty hops come through in the middle. The finish is earthy bitter with a touch of pine resin. Light medium body with good carbonation. This is a nice pale ale that deserves a spot in any rotation. Borderline sessionable.","1347: 12oz can. A) Pours with a tight, creamy head. Takes a bit to settle. Hazy body, amber in color. Sticky lacing. S) Piney. Grapefruit. Caramel. T) Well balanced flavor combination. Caramel. Orange. Starts a little bit bitter then moves right into the malty sweetness. Finishes with a hop bit and subtle spruce and alcohol. M) Crisp up front then smooths out. Medium body. D) A well crafted brew. I'd definitely drink another one.","1353: Nice amber color and sticky white head. Light hop presence backed by a strong malt body and a bit of yeast. A bit flowery and sweet. Tastes solidly malty with a decent hop touch. A bit sour on the finish but otherwise not bad at all. Finishes smooth as well. Not bad, a more enjoyable amber and very nice looking to say the least.","1386: Vintage 2010. A: Quarter finger light mocha fades to translucent of the same. Beer is dark, dark brown. No lacing to speak of. S: Extra roasty. Coffee, graham, cocoa, malt, licorice. I can say, however, the hops are still quite present. Piney, resiny. Malt dominant, but still hoppy. T: Roast, cocoa, coffee, lighter hops with earthy feel. Good beer. Not spending much time here, but this is really good. M: thick and syrupy. Like a good beer should be in this genre. D: this is a really good beer. I hate to be a slave to price point, but at nearly $13 for a bomber, I want to be wowed. The beer is good, really really good. If under $9\u002fbomber, I would be all about this one.","1394: From a 12 oz. can....Dropped hard into my imperial pint produces a big white fine head, over a hazy apple juice looking fluid. Crisp citrus smell with a hop presence as well. I taste hops right up front, with a dry bitter citrus finish. Much better as it warms. The head pretty much disappeared, but left some nice lacing. I can absolutely get a subtle tangerine smell from the beer, but a strong smell from the can. This is a very good canned beer. I wish I could buy it around here.","1398: Poured from 12 oz can into pint mug: A - Dark golden amber in color. Clear, with nice 2 finger, off-white head. Excellent lacing on glass. S - Citrus,pine, grassy, malty. T - Golden malt at first; quickly followed by citrus and pine. Finishes fairly dry but leaves slight metallic aftertaste. M - Medium. Carbonation is very fine in character. D - As big as this is on flavor, I would have thought the ABV would be more than 6.1%. It's very drinkable; but at @ $14.006 pack it will have to be an occasional treat.","1403: Poured from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass, the beer has a deep red-copper color with a small, thin 1\u002f2\" head that dissipates quickly. The beer is heavily smelling of hops and floral, with a little bit of a smokey background. The hops flavor hits the middle of the tongue, and there is a very short lasting, bitter undertone to it. There is a bitter and at the same time sour aftertaste to the finish, and the bitter portion of that will linger from some time after the beer is gone. It's a heavy IPA that is full of flavor in mouth, but the lingering aftertaste makes this a \"one and done\" for me. I thoroughly enjoy this beer, but one bomber at a time.","1411: A- Nice bright red color with a pretty foamy head. Lace is allready showing off and trying to get me to take a sip before finishing the sentance. S- Heavy citrus blend with a sweet finish. Smells like a much hoppier beer than an IPA. T- Much maltier than the nose lets on, sweeter too. I taste a lot of grain and oils. Slightly buttery. M- Truely a medium bodied sample. Not watery but definatley not full either. D- Good pick up from the store as something new. Not something I would recommend to a friend as a must try, but a maybe try for those looking to try new IPAs. Thanks Caldera...another decent brew from Oregon.","1412: A: A light orange gold, with modest tightly knit bit of head that stays. S: Nice piney, grapefruit and citrus, hint of biscuity malts T: First flavors are a strong, piney, grapefruit bite, with a tad of crystalish malts barely balancing it out, then a bitter finish of resinous west coast hops. M: Medium bodied, average carbonation, slightly sticky, cloying finish. maybe from the hops. D: Decent drinkability, though I've had much more drinkable IPA's. Still a very delicious west coast IPA well worth the try. Just probably wouldn't make this session beer.","1445: Pours very nice dark golden yellow color, nice carbonation, awesome two finger creamy white head, lots and lots of nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, very nice touch of hops, slight citrus, and caramel. The taste is a nice blend of hops\u002fmalts, somce citrus\u002fcaramel. The finish is dry and bitter. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a very nice Pale Ale, recommended.","1449: A - Pours a hazy burnt orange. A billowy 3 finger head. Average lacing. S - Big citrus aroma, caramel, hints of alcohol, dried herbs. T - Citrus hops with some strawberry fruitiness. Some floral spice in the back fades into toasted caramel malt. The malt has a nice sweetness that keeps the hops from taking over everything. The malt seems shy at first but opens up as you go. My first IPA out of a can. Very easy drinking. Good stuff!","1479: A - pours a deep rust orange with 1\u002f4 inch of white foam S - citrus and hints of piney hops T - slightly citrus hops with a major piney hop kick at the end, not overpoweringly bitter, just a really tasty treat M\u002fD - medium bodied and decent carbonation, definitely a nice IPA that I could have several of","1493: 12oz can poured into a pint glass Pours a bright yellow with nice head, very little lacing. Smells slightly hoppy, mostly wet greens. Taste is a tiny little bit of honey and a fair amount of hops, some floral. Nice bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light and effervescent. Pretty drinkable. Not as good as their IPA, I don't think.","1532: Pours crystal clear golden amber, yellowish thick head, chunky head that falls leaving ample lacing. Smells like cidery malt, hops seemed to be subdued, slight fruitiness. Taste is bitter up front, astringent bitterness twang, slight malt but the body is too light to carry the bitterness. Borderline metallic taste, slightest fruitiness. Not the most fantastic but something I can finish, I'd probably buy this again, as the brew isn't too heavy like some IPAs.","1548: Poured from the can into a Sam Adams \"Perfect\" pint glass. (I don't know why, but beer seems to taste better out of this glass vs a regular pint glass. Call me crazy) A - Nice dark burnt orange color, off-white head, good lacing. S - Pine, grapefruit, mango, nice!!! T - Bitter and piney upfront, with a nice grapefuit and earthy end. Well balanced. Tasty. M - Medium with medium amount of carbonation. D - High. Very tasting and refreshing. Not the hoppiest IPA out there, but well-balanced and tasty. Extremely easy to drink. Great beer. I am really starting to like these Caldera guys!","1564: Dark red color, light beige foam, average. In the smell malt and caramel, not really light. Again malt and caramel in the taste, not bad in the end. Maybe a note of honey in teh back, and a light fruitiness. Average body. In the aftertaste a light bitterness, with the malt and red fruit. Nothing exceptional, but not bad, drinkable beer.","1583: Golden with a dense white head and a massive cascading of carbonation rising to the surface. Clean, sweet, graininess with a nice dose of floral\u002fcitric\u002f herbal hops. Cascades are definitely at work in this brew. Finish is dry and crisp with a perfect amount of bitterness. A more than solid Pale Ale from the folks at Caldera. This one is all West Coast.","1585: I got this one as an extra from one of those awesome West Coast BAs! Thanks! This one pours a nice golden color with an off-whie head. Nice lacing that lasts. Upon popping the top I was hit immediately by a cascate of hoppy smells coming from the can. Smells delicious with the malt to balance things nicely. The taste follows the nose with a nice, crisp finish. In the mouth this one is nice and creamy. This is a highly drinkable beer. It has a nice hoppy dry finish that keeps your mouth wanting more.","1589: Pours a deep gold with a 2 finger head that dissipates to a fine layer, leaving lots of sticky lacing on the glass. Floral hoppy aromas, salty biscuits, and a whiff of ginger. Malty biscuit flavor, then a strong taste of bitter greens\u002fgreen pepper, with a lingering grapefruit finish. Hops are a bit numbing on the tongue. Body is light and the carbonation is enough to give this a moderately creamy mouthfeel. Eminently drinkable beer, for those who like their IPAs with a bitter green hop taste.","1593: The beer pours a nice yellow-orange, with a thick white head. Looks delish. Maybe its my nose, but I don't detect too much - citrusy hops with a pine undergirding. But the taste is exceptional. Wonderfully bright hops and a satisfying malt backbone. But like most west coast ipas, this is not balanced...thankfully. A hops explosion of grapefruit, spice, and pine. Awesome. This is the best IPA i've had in a can...and one of the better ones around PERIOD. Check this one out.","1623: A: Beer poured a light amber color with a orange hue and large 1\" off white head that lasted for sometime. Good lacing on the sides of the glass throughout consumption. S: Citrus, orange pith, pine, and some light caramel notes. T: As with the smell I get grapefruit, orange pith, lots of pine and some light caramel malt balance. This one is pretty hop dominate. M: Medium-light bodied, good carbonation with a drying finish. D: This beer is definately six pack worth and will be one of my camping beers from here on out.","1626: Pours a crisp clear pale gold color with a small head that dissipates rather quickly. Has a bitter hoppy pine and citrus smell. Very pungent for a APA. Bitter bite hits right away and fades to a smooth caramel malty biscuity flavor. Not very complex, but good tastes none the less. A very light smooth beer. Very sessionable could def hammer a few of these back.","1627: HOPS! If you like a hoppy beer, this is for you. Pours a golden brown with a nice foamy head. Complex flavors keep you interested with citrus and fruity notes. Just enough maltiness to keep the hops from being completely overwhelming. Aroma is strong with fruity citrus notes as well.","1649: A: Poured a hazy amber color with a nice white cap S: Faded piney hops, caramel T: Caramel and faded hops battle for dominance while the metallic and old Earthy notes fight for second place. Bad. M: Medium to full body and not one I would recommend hiolding on your palate O: Poor IPA, drainpoured after two sips","1658: First micro brew for me in a can. Cool logo but with no freshness date. It pours a amber color with a nice sea foam head. The smell is strong of hops. The taste hits you with a dry hop appeal with a huge hop profile. It leaves a stinging pleasant aftertaste as it journeys down the throat. I really like the uniqueness of the this American IPA profile.","1666: 22oz bottle A- Pours a hazy amber color with an off-white head with decent retention and lacing. S- The aroma is sweet malt and some citrus notes from the centennial hops as well. The aroma is good, but a little more subdued than I was expecting. T- The taste like the aroma is smooth and malty up front with the hops coming in and lingering well into the finish. M- The mouthfeel is light bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. D- Overall, I enjoyed Hopportunity Knocks but I isn't a beer I would likely seek out again. Worth a try.","1679: Okay, pilseners aren't that hard to make, but being able to match what I drank in Germany? Well, that's a tall order. With that said, this reminded me of the beers I drank in Germany, when I favored the crisp, clean taste of a cold pilsener. The color is straw yellow and crystal-clear. The smell is light and floral, and the taste is crisp, malty-sweet and lightly hopped. In addition, the hops hit you then disappear. The mouthfeel is light, as a pilsener should be. Overall, an exceptional beer!","1682: poured into a tulip from a can with a two finger head and a deep copperish golden color with a slight reddish hue. smells like a slight twinge of alcohol and a floral yet citrusy hop aroma. and a sugary sweet malt backbone. Taste is bitterup front with a citrusy tongue with a sweet malt finish. relly quite impresive for my first craft beer from a can. super complex and tasty as hell. Mouth is suprisingly clean with a bite in the front. drinks moderately and really suprised me. For the cost I can't say it's worth it. 14.99 a six pack is steep for this one but it is a damn fine beer.","1693: 12oz can courtesy of Reino poured into a pint glass. Pours a clear light golden with a decent creamy white head that hung on as a cap for a while leaving good lacing. The aroma is very light with lots of lemony hops up front and a bit of bready malts as well. The flavor had the light citrus up front with the malts in the middle before giving way to some faint pine hop bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated and lighter than most pale ales. This is a very drinkable pale that doesn't have too much differentiation but is still tasty.","1697: appearance - light amber color, just a little darker than I expected from the nose, big frothy head. Smell - very nice hop, pine, some fruit taste - nice hoppy grapefruite taste, dry finish mouthfeel - very even, not too thin, not too chewy for a single ipa overall - solid, I doubt I will pay $12.99 again for this brew and it probably factored into my rating","1709: Exceptionally pale yellow with vigorous carbonation, a light white head, fogged body, and full abstract lace. This simple session lager has a sustained head, a light appealing aroma, and enough Saaz to keep your feet tapping. Could use a catchier name though. Served on tap at the Siskiyou Pub, Ashland, OR.","1711: 22 picked up at Brewforia on the way home from work. Poured into my big Shorts Imperial Pint (thanks Kevin). Foamy 1\" white head dies back into nice lacing... no real retention though... okay cap... the brew is very pale golden with seemingly a lite haze of some sort. Clean grains... little else.. a bit husky and traces of sulfur if I really concentrate. Again... very clean.... pale malts... a bit doughy. Slightly better than expected body and carbonation. Meh... okay I guess... good for what it is... tastes pretty fresh and crisp. 3.5\u002f3\u002f3.5\u002f3.5\u002f4.5","1717: 12oz bottle into pint glass. Pours a slightly hazy deep gold color with off-white head. Nose gives off notes of mango and grassiness with honey maltiness. Taste is mellow and spicy with notes of date and dried plums. Grassy and green hop presence with smooth bitterness. Moderate carbonation with a dry finish and lingering bitterness. Overall a nice pale ale that has a well-rounded (albeit bitter) flavor profile. Not as full-bodied as others, but good nonetheless.","1721: a- can poured into a pint, two finger off white head with nice retention, hazy tawny amber coloring. s- earthy hops, some pine, grapefruit pith, bitterness, slight malt. t- earthy, bitter grapefruit rind dominates, some pine, some lemon, tasty lingering bitterness as well. m- medium body, slick. d- good, i'd drink this again, but probably wouldn't seek out and buy. this is a solid canned craft ipa though.","1729: Orangeish with a peach head. Smell was hoppy. Taste was hoppy, not alot else going on. Not exciting but not boring either. It was easy to swallow but not alot else. Its something I could drink a few of. Good if you want a session beer but don't want a strong flavor.","1730: Interesting beer...not too sure how I feel about this. Looks good enough...cloudy orange with a decent white head. Malty, very floral smell. Creamy, light caramel scent. Light hops. Weird, floraly hop taste. Sour-ish after taste. Weird, bready character. Definitely can taste the rose, but its all muddled. Nothing really stands out. Slightly flat, not horrible. I think this would be better as a pint or a six pack, not a bomber.","1737: A 12 ounce can from a sixer I picked up at Abe's for $11. Poured into my Ithaca shaker glass. The IPA appears a super clear golden amber color with about a finger of off white foam. The head leaves a nice looking lace in its wake. Nose and flavors consist of bready, caramel malt, perfume, a bit of bitter grapefruit pith, lime, lemon, lightly toasted rolls. Medium bodied with adequate carbonation. I thought this would be super fresh and hoppy since this brewery just came into PA a week or so ago. I was a bit let down, especially judging by the reviews here. Needs more hops...","1738: More of a 'dry' than a lager, tasted at the 2002 Oregon Brewers Festival. Orange color, orange flavor in nose. Light malts and fairly aggressively hopped; yet it is not very bitter. Interesting taste, complex and subtle. Light yet flavorful. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Nice beer. Would be a great beer to sip during a hot summer day.","1741: 12oz can. A) Pours with a finger thick, white head that takes awhile to settle. Slightly hazy body. Active carbonation. Gold in color. Nice sticky lacing on the drink down. S) Pink grapefruit. A hint of evergreen. T) The initial flavors are washed out by the fizz. Once beyond that some dry nutty-ness liken to walnut. Grapefruit rind. A mellow sweetness throughout but not the main stay. A nice hop bite in the finish, but seems a bit too much for a pale ale. M) Quite fizzy. Medium body. Dry. D) A decent brew. I'd have another.","1753: Pours out a pale straw like color with a bubbly 2 finger deep white head. Smells of light flowery Cascade hoppiness, pine, spruce, tropical. Flavor is soft bisquity maltiness, piney hops, faint caramel sweetness, earthy tone, nicely balanced. Crisp, clean, light to medium bodied, lingering bitterness. Highly drinkable. excellent summer session brew. Should be a campsite\u002fcooler standard.","1759: Standard lighter yellow pale ale here, good foamy head. Nice soft floral hop arrangement, if you like caldera, you'll be all good here. Plenty of taste in a pale, relative hefty amount of hops for style, light, ever so light toasting of the malt allows the hops to shine without making them exist in a ridiculous amount. Bitterness is sturdy, minty and metallic, but not a distraction or covering up the more delicate aspect of the beer, would say it leans to the grapefruit side of hop taste, cascade, chinook seem to be all over this one.","1764: Poured a deep copper hue with a one and a half finger foamy white head. There was good retention and lacing. The smell featured a full cereal grain, caramel and a citric hop. The taste was mainly hop driven with a grain full malt behind. Citus and pine dominated. Theouthfeel was typical of the style with a very dry finish. Overall a tasty hop driven west coast ale.","1769: Great golden color-very clear-a tad deeper in in color then some pales. Good aroma-mellow hopiness to it-sort of grassy. Great flavor-well balanced between a good level of bitterness and the malt. Really good hop flavor to it as well as the bitterness. Good body as well. Very, very drinkable beer. Almost a shame to drink it right from the can!!!! As much as I love macros I cant help but say whoo hoo great beer in a can lets go camping!!!","1773: 12oz can courtesy of Unclejedi, thanks! nice orange color with a foamy, sticky white head. Smells hoppy, resin, catty, nice. The taste is nicely balanced with the hops not really taking over just blending in to the picture. The mouthfeel is very smooth. Another example of good beer in a can.","1776: Pours a clear, amber color. 1\u002f2 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of strong hops and slight earthy malt. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of strong hops, some sweet malt, and some earthy malt. Overall, a very tasty IPA and by far the best beer I've ever had from a can. This was practically mind blowing for me to really enjoy a canned beer. Definitely worth a try!","1789: Poured from a can into a a Chouffe Flute A-Very deep nice amber\u002fdark copper laces thick and sticky down the glass, very sexy looking in the glass. S-very floral bitter hop smell. Grapefruit notes very citrusy. T-Much like the nose great bitterness in the front middle and back. Has a nice sweet malt quality in the middle, almost like a sweeter orange flavor very subtle but adds alot. M-Medium body near perfect on the carbonation. D-Only reason this is not a 5 is the price everything else about this beer on this section is flawless.","1811: A: pours clear, pale orange maybe some yellow. The head is about a finger and a half of off white head. The head did settle down to a thin layer and did leave a good amount of lacing. S: malt is sweet, slightly grainy. Hops are a little piny, and a little bit grassy. T: again with the sweet lightly grainy malt. Hops bring about, mostly pine, a little citrus, and even some grass to the palate. M: carbonation is tingly and nice. Otherwise it smooth on the palate. O: yet another impressive brew from a can, good balanced flavor.","1821: 12 ounce can. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a hazy amber color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention is pretty good, and there is a lot of lacing left behind on the glass. Aroma is herbal and citrusy hops, along with a bit of sweet malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, it's mostly hops with some sweet malt noticable too. There's also a nice lingering bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel\u002fbody is medium, it's slick with moderate carbonation. It's easy enough to drink. I think it's a good solid IPA. I'd buy this one again in the future.","1831: A-Pours an orange\u002famber color with a dense, pillowy, white, one finger head. S-Grapefruit, pine and mango with some pineapple and light carmale notes. T-Bitter pine, pineapple, some grapefruit with light malt and a dry bitter finish. M-Pretty crisp and dry in the mouthfeel with medium body and pirckly, but low carbonation. D-Really nice IPA. It has most of the things that I look for in an IPA: some malt backbone, a nice bitter hop burst and a great fragrant nose.","1850: A: pours amber orange with a decent finger of off white head. S: grapefruit and light pine, and floral hop. There is some malt sweetness in the background. T: a nice tounge coating hop, that is piny, a citrus cross between grapefruit and orange. Malt is light but nicely sweet. M: coating hop, though the malt is light in the mouth, good carbonation. O: canned beer is really starting to grow on me, and leaves me impressed enough to try calderas other offerings","1855: Good IPA and in a can!!! Pours a light amber\u002fgolden clear color with a medium sized frothy white head. Average retention and thick rings of lacing. Smell includes piney and citrus hops. Prominent and good. Tastes good as well. Piney and citrus hops and enough malt to be able to say balanced. The hops win out and the beer is still bitter but also smooth, crisp and easy to drink. Mouthfeel is crisp and starts out a bit thin. But like many IPAs, the hops coat the tongue and make the beer appear more rich. Drinkability is good. Good tasting, balanced and smooth.","1856: Sampled from a can with no freshness date. Big billowy off-white head with decent retention. Burnt orange in color. Medium bodied with an oily feel and aggressive carbonation. Solid caramel malty aroma with a hint of citrusy grapfruit hop flavor near the finish. Orange citrus flavores up front that transitions to bitter pine hop flavor that quickly follows thru the middle and to the finish. Noce caramel malt undertone throughout. Decent hop character and balance but lacked the hop intensity of a really goof IPA.","1859: Thanks to bman1113vr for sharing this bottle. The beer pours a clear brown color with a tan head. The aroma is heavy on the toffee and not too much else. The flavor is toffee, leather, tobacco, wood and dark fruit. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A decent beer but nothing too exciting.","1871: Poured from the can a clear golden hue with two fingers of bright white head. Good lacing all around. Aroma is slightly sour and malty much like a pilsner. A slight whiff of sulfur and vegetables as well. The taste has a bitter edge along with malt and biscuit. Lighter bodied, dry, and moderately carbonated. Pretty drinkable, but this is a fairly decent pale ale that sits in the middle of the pack.","1893: Smell is light, almost non-existent, must be trapped in the dark amber. Very light head tops a thin effervescent surface. Taste is belgian yet bitter, with very little of the promised oranges. I'm getting a lot of roast out of this, which normally would be a compliment but it just doesn't fit what I was expecting. Aside from the bitter notes the beer is pretty good, it's almost like a belgian strong dark coffee stout ale.","1905: Clear dark amber with a good three finger white head. Plentiful lacings. Aroma is fruity citrus hops with a bit of leather. Taste is full deep leathery bitter hops with the correct amount of malts. The label describes \"centennial hops\" as the mainstay of all that bitterness. Mouthfeel is just right, and drinkability is very good for this style. Kudos to Caldera for daring to bottle a limited production beer. Their normal regimen is cans. Cool label. Give the fellows from the \"State of Jefferson\" a big thumbs up! Keep it coming Caldera!","1907: Poured into an imperial nonic a clear copper with a great one finger sticky white head that nver really leaves,a frothy mass is there during the whole duration of the glass.Big caramel malt in the nose with subdued citric hops,a little hop oomph and it would be great.Citric and herbal hops play against a big caramel\u002fbiscuit malt base with neither getting the upper heand really.There is a little lightly roasted nuttiness in the malt profile as well.A beer thats oh so close to being stellar,just bump up the hop profile and there you go,as is its pretty good.","1910: Amber brown in color with very little head but a nice ring. Nicely carbonated. Smells like a camp fire, malts have a good sweet character with an abundance of smoke. Taste is quite good with smokiness being pungent but not overwelming. A sweet tasting bock with smokiness coming through around mid drink with a smooth mellow finish. A good warming smoky beer.","1919: Appearance - Pours a pale golden color with about a finger of quickly dissipating head that leaves little lacing on the edges of the glass. Smell - Light hops, grainy malts, breadyness. Taste - Taste is similar to the nose with a hint of caramel\u002fhoney. Nothing really stands out to me as special, but then again what do you expect with the description on the side of this. Mouthfeel - Light bodied, prickly carbonation. Drinkability - Quite drinkable to be honest, however as someone else stated, might as well buy some PBR's rather than spend money on this.","1938: Poured this 12 oz. can into a Sam Adams glass. No date. The body was pale gold. The head was modest and bright white leaving only bits of lace. Smell was a pungent, leafy, skunky hops - yum!. Tea, which was strong but faded. Taste was green and grassy with a nice lingering bitter finish. Not hasrsh, but flavorful. Enough biscuity malts to give it some pale ale balance. Very solid and highly drinkable. Mouthfeel was medium to light in body. Adequate carbonation, finishes pretty smooth. (My 700th review)","1940: Reddish amber with good clarity. Modest head that leaves light lacing. Pretty color, but fairly unusual for an IPA. Pleasant nose but more malty than hoppy - graham cracker maybe? Herbal hop character with moderate lingering bitterness. A bit metallic. Medium bodied. A bit juicy but metallic bitterness builds to dominate the impression.","443: A: Poured a dark amber with good carbonation leaving a nice white head S: Citrus and pine notes with light booze, light caramel and bread T: Some piney resin, floral and citrus notes with a nice sharp hop bite M: Good carbonation and feel but a little light on the body, maybe I am just used to drink to many IIPAs that i am tainted D: Good and worth a try.","39: A can picked up in Baltimore. Pours a clear amber color with lots of foamy off-white head. Good retention leaves some spotty lacing. Smells of grassy hops, bread, caramel, and earth. Tastes of bread, toasted grains, caramel, lite citrus, and an earthy and grassy finish. Medium in body with good carbonation. Clean and smooth, malty and grainy with a nice bitter finish. Refreshing and easy to drink, a nice canned amber ale that I would definitely enjoy while out and about in the Summer time.","43: Had this on 2011-09-23 in Lynchburg, VA A - Almost clear, orange-amber with a 2-finger off-white head with big bubbles and moderate lacing. S - Fairly strong aroma that can be smelled 18\" away. Sweet malt, citrus and hop floral. T - Much like the aroma. Sweet bread and fruit followed by a dash of orange flesh a touch of spice and finally orange rind bitterness doesn't dominate. A pleasant, well-balanced bitter-sweet taste although it doesn't blow my hair back. M - Medium body and carbonation. A bit syrupy with some prickle O - I enjoyed this brew. It has a lot of flavor for being 6.1% ABV.","81: Thanks to hopdog for this... Appears a hazy, light orange with a small white head that fades into a mild collar and film. Spotty lacing is left around the glass. Smell is nice of citrusy hops, along with some notes of pine sap and herbs. Taste is of the mentioned aromas with caramel and citrus notes battling it out with a mild spiciness going on in the flavor. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, yeasty, sweet up front, and bitter on the end.","103: Pours a dark amber with a moderate head. Smell is pretty nice! Pine and tropical fruits. Taste starts with a nice blend of bitter pine and fruit punch, without being overly sweet. Pretty dry finish, medium-light mouth. This is a nice little surprise and drinkable but not complex enough to be interesting beyond one. But overall for what it is, Caldera has a winner.","125: Thanks to Djeucalyptus for these! Poured from the can to a tulip. Fairly clear pale orange with a sticky, long lasting head. Lots of lacing. Fairly pungent resiny, piney aromas. Taste is very piney right away. Good hop bite and very crisp and clean feel. Just a great, easy drinking ipa- right up there with other great ones as far as drinkablity. Great beer!","248: a: dark brown with amber highlights, no head or lacing. s: dark malts, medicine, little orange and rubbing alochol. t: malts, caramel, no medicine but dark fruits, other than bitters no other orange taste detected. m: full body with some bitterness. o: worth trying once, dont think i'll seek this one out again.","305: Poured from a 12 oz can to a pint glass the liquid is yellow with good carbonation. The head is almost 2 fingers white and leaves good lace. The smell is real nice sweet piney and citrus notes. The taste follows, piney citrus notes, and a bready malt that is quite good. The mouthfeel is also nice, crisp and clean, smooth and a good body, the carbonation is real good. The drinkability is good, a easy drinking brew, wroth a try. Prosit, MK","348: copper or amber in color. pretty clear with an off-white hop head forming on top. smells of pine up front and a hit of citrus zest toward the back. taste is refreshingly hopped. malty sweetness amongst the pine, resins, and citrus. mouthfeel is crispy with a slight bite. definetly drinkable.","407: 12oz can. Poured a medium amber color with an averagd sized off white head. Aromas of pine, earthy, floral, and citrus. Tastes of pine, citrus, and some caramel. Nice grapefruit bitter finish. A vert nice IPA and from a can too! Notes from: 09\u002f14\u002f07.","552: A: Very pale golden color with pretty much no head whatsoever. S: Kind of weird but a little intriguing as well. Lots of rose petals and rose water here. Some faint hints of yeast and bread as well. T: Yeah, this isn't good. Lots of floral notes but there's no hint of the base beer here at all. A bit of a buttery note with some yeast, but that's about it. Mouthfeel is waaay thin and watery.","683: No Canned on Date A - Pours a rich amber color. Completely clear, with minimal head. S - Sweet hoppy syrupy smells. Hints of piney resin. T - Piney, resin, floral hops. No noticeable citrus qualities. Finishes very dry and bitter. M - Medium body with moderate to high carbonation. Just right for an IPA. D - Nothing I would go out of my to get again, but nothing I'd turn down either. This is a solid IPA. Not a lot to rant about, both positive and negative. The flavors are pretty one dimensional, bitter piney hops, no citrus undertones that I enjoy so much.","720: A - Dark gold, almost amber ale with a nice, dense, bubbly head that descends slowly and leaves nice lacing. The head revives with a swirl. S - Pine and grapefruit with a touch of wet leather. T\u002fM - Hops and leather with a touch of pine and grapefruit. Nicely supportive carbonation. The trick was to let it warm up a bit. As it warmed, it became more complex and rich. When it was cold it came across as a bit thinner so choose\u002fmake your preference. D - The alcohol is in check. If you choose to drink it cold it's ideal as a warm weather ale. Otherwise, enjoy it with seafood (e.g., mussels). Yum.","741: I got this beer from Tilley4. Thanks Jason! 12oz can served in a standard pint glass. L - slightly hazed copper color with a bone white head that left trails of lacing. S - citrus rind and a slab of butter rolled in dirt. T - bitter citrus rind upfront with some buttery notes before getting dry and tart on the finish. F - medium bodied with a biting feel and smooth carbonation. D - goes down quick and easy.","808: It has a dark bronze and amber body. The head and lace are full, rocky and tan. The aroma is sweet but there is some yeast spice and little floral accents. It reminds me of a pale ale flavor a bit bitter, grapefruit like but has a sweet melon finish. The mouthfeel is medium. The carbonation had a lot of staying power.","854: Tastes like a hopped grapefruit, which sounds terrible but drinks pretty nice. Citrus is not overwhelming, but it's in there. I think I prefer my citrus lean toward lemon, but this is fine. Frankly, the best reason to drink this is the vessel. Drink outside by the grill on a sunny day. Go cans.","876: Thanks to rayjay for the extra in a trade. Pours a slightly hazy orange with a nice, tight white head that laces like glue. Smells of massive amounts of hops, damn near all of them. Lots of citrus and pine, with some caramel malt as well. Tastes wonderfully hoppy, tons of pine and citrus yet an almost grainy note, also slightly vegetal. There is a lot of malt here to back things up, there's a nice tight carbonation and it feels dense. Very easy to drink on after an evening of flying frizbee.","1073: Thanks to 5000 for sending this can my way. The beer pours a dark amber color with a white head. Darker than expected. The aroma is very nice. I get a lot of grapefruit and pine notes. The flavor is similar. The predominant flavor is some resiny pine from the hops but I also get some grapefruit. The toffee and caramel malt backbone balance out the beer nicely and keep the bitterness level fairly low for a west coast IPA. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very nice.","1143: Pours a bronze\u002famber color with a thick, creamy, fluffy white head. Dies down and leaves a lot of lacing along the side of the glass. Smell is highly, bitterly hopped. I think I can smell mt. hood hops, pine, black pepper, grass\u002fweedy smell, earthy. Taste is completely bittering with a smooth body. Black pepper in the taste, as well as that earthiness to it. Light carbonation brings out the slight malty flavors. Mostly though its pretty hoppy.","1145: Was pretty excited to see some limited 22's from Caldera down this way. Interesting art work on the bottle. A-ruby, brown almost a dark mahogany, small half finger head and translucent S-Orange, cherry and chocolate-Terry Chocolate Orange upfront, a faint grassy smell in the end T- light malts and belgian yeast. light orange and cherries with a slight bitterness on the end M-watery, light carbonation, not much body to it D-Overall, the taste was interesting but light, I wish it tasted as good as the smell was. There was not much body to this one for being a strong dark Belgian.","1261: A: Poured a copperish orange color with good carbonation and a nice white head S: Caramel, bread, pine and light booze T: Taste follows nose pretty well. Balanced, with a good caramel and breadiness, floral and pine notes M: Nice lingering bitterness and sweet, sticky feel D: Good","1289: Review is from notes A: Orange, cloudy, head sticks around a while S: Smells like cat piss (not a bad thing strangely),very floral, hoppy T: Bitter up front, nice malt back, M: Easy to drink - mild carbonation D: All day long. Great offering from Caldera considering their PA wasn't all that great.","1398: Poured from 12 oz can into pint mug: A - Dark golden amber in color. Clear, with nice 2 finger, off-white head. Excellent lacing on glass. S - Citrus,pine, grassy, malty. T - Golden malt at first; quickly followed by citrus and pine. Finishes fairly dry but leaves slight metallic aftertaste. M - Medium. Carbonation is very fine in character. D - As big as this is on flavor, I would have thought the ABV would be more than 6.1%. It's very drinkable; but at @ $14.006 pack it will have to be an occasional treat.","1404: Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Appearance: Pours a clear very dark redish amber with a finger of tan head that fades to a ring. Smell: Malty with some fruity notes along with mild chocolate and spice. Taste: More fruit here than in the smell. Malty and quite sweet, I'm picking up just a bit of the orange. The finish is malty and bitter. Mouthfeel: Medium body with prickly carbonation and a dry finish. Overall: Not as much citrus and I would have expected. I would have liked more fruit to go along with everything else. I would probably pass on this one in the future.","1490: Drank 11\u002f5\u002f11 A: A slightly reddish amber hue, with a head that dissipates quickly and completely. Intriguing simply because it's a different color. S: It smells like an orange chocolate bar. Not what I was expecting at all, but I like it. Not the most exceptional or complex beer I've had, but it's good. T: Again, orange chocolate. Mmm mmm good. Very well balanced, and not a hint of booze. M: Good intermediate body, but nothing special. O: I enjoyed this beer, but I much prefer Caldera's other offerings.","1649: A: Poured a hazy amber color with a nice white cap S: Faded piney hops, caramel T: Caramel and faded hops battle for dominance while the metallic and old Earthy notes fight for second place. Bad. M: Medium to full body and not one I would recommend hiolding on your palate O: Poor IPA, drainpoured after two sips","1709: Exceptionally pale yellow with vigorous carbonation, a light white head, fogged body, and full abstract lace. This simple session lager has a sustained head, a light appealing aroma, and enough Saaz to keep your feet tapping. Could use a catchier name though. Served on tap at the Siskiyou Pub, Ashland, OR.","1850: A: pours amber orange with a decent finger of off white head. S: grapefruit and light pine, and floral hop. There is some malt sweetness in the background. T: a nice tounge coating hop, that is piny, a citrus cross between grapefruit and orange. Malt is light but nicely sweet. M: coating hop, though the malt is light in the mouth, good carbonation. O: canned beer is really starting to grow on me, and leaves me impressed enough to try calderas other offerings","1859: Thanks to bman1113vr for sharing this bottle. The beer pours a clear brown color with a tan head. The aroma is heavy on the toffee and not too much else. The flavor is toffee, leather, tobacco, wood and dark fruit. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A decent beer but nothing too exciting.","872: one word WOW! this has to be one of the hoppiest beers I've ever had, the hop profile is well preseved inside its 12 oz can. Pours a warm copper color with a huge floral aroma of hops. I would say the freshness of the hops makes it almost over hopped and hard to drink. But, it is a must for any hop head to try. Not your average canned beer...try one you love it or hate it...","127: Had this on tap at the recently opened Hawthorne Hophouse. Hadn't been there before. I'll review it soon. They served this one in a 12oz. tulip. A: This beer has a dark brown reddish look that had a pretty tan looking head. S: It smells quite intense. A resin malty scent that carries with it some alcohol. T: This beer tastes like resiny caramel. It is a little sweet and has a long drawn out flavor. M: It dries out your mouth with the lingering dry aftershock. Not a very carbonated beer. Quite a bit of body for even this color. D: I could have a few of these. Definately an intense strong ale, but I'll admit I'm a sucker for Caldera.","201: Great pale ale. Really sticks out among this blahh category. Very well balanced and refreshing. Nice hop aroma and taste but finish is well balanced. Hops and malt are just the right combo. Just what a pale ale is supposed to be. Very surprised by this brewery I'd never heard of.","549: Suprised by the hoppy taste from this can. Consumed at a bar called the Tin Can in St. Louis. Citrus notes in the initial smell gives way to a hoppy and well carbonated first drink. I also pick up a little banana aroma. I drank this brew straight from the can which probably didn't assist the experience but it us definitely a drinkable ipa. As previously stated it is quite hoppy for a can which is refreshing. I am not able to get this at home so I am glad that I tried it.","765: I didn't know what to expect from this brew when I ordered it up. I think the thing to keep in mind is this: if you are not a hop-head but love the flavor of the hop smell, this is the one for you! When I took the first sip, I realized that what this should have been called is \"hopjuice\". The taste is the supreme incarnation of Cascade hop aroma stripped off of the bitterness. I thought it was wonderful, although I knocked it down because the underlying beer characteristic did not push through as much as I would have liked. Being a NW interpretation of Red, however, the balance stood on its own very well. Terrific and recommended if you can get it.","856: 12oz can $2. I did not care for this beer. It looked good, orange, pale, good lace, decent head. It smelled kind of weak but not bad. It tasted like stale iced tea and I did not care for that flavor one bit. The IPA I had from this brewer was much better than this. For my money I'd stick with Full Sail Pale Ale for a couple dollars less.","911: My main man woodychandler comes through with yet another canned beer for me to try. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a orange\u002fbrownish color with a 1\u002f2 inch head. Smell is very hoppy, not much else. Taste is also all hops, dry and bitter, not much else coming through. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer.","1240: A: Pours to a frothey tan head with a deep and beautiful copper body. Excellent lacing. S: Slight, hoppy, piney aroma. T: Citrusy with piney hops. Crisp and not real bitter but it does have a slight bite with lasting flavor. The hops definitely comes through. A nice IPA that doesn't knock you over. Typically what an IPA is suppose to be. M: Lightly carbonated, smooth and thin. Not watery or oily. D: Refreshing and while not a session beer, you can easily enjoy a couple of these without any problems. One of the better canned micro-brews that I have tried.","1334: Wierd tasting IPA, thrown in a trade. Starts OK, and then residual odd hop flavours. Medium yellow body, a quarter inch of white foam. A little hop aromas. Not skunky, but just another AMerican IPA to me, with moe astringency than balance. A bit aggressive carbonation.","1403: Poured from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass, the beer has a deep red-copper color with a small, thin 1\u002f2\" head that dissipates quickly. The beer is heavily smelling of hops and floral, with a little bit of a smokey background. The hops flavor hits the middle of the tongue, and there is a very short lasting, bitter undertone to it. There is a bitter and at the same time sour aftertaste to the finish, and the bitter portion of that will linger from some time after the beer is gone. It's a heavy IPA that is full of flavor in mouth, but the lingering aftertaste makes this a \"one and done\" for me. I thoroughly enjoy this beer, but one bomber at a time.","1627: HOPS! If you like a hoppy beer, this is for you. Pours a golden brown with a nice foamy head. Complex flavors keep you interested with citrus and fruity notes. Just enough maltiness to keep the hops from being completely overwhelming. Aroma is strong with fruity citrus notes as well.","1658: First micro brew for me in a can. Cool logo but with no freshness date. It pours a amber color with a nice sea foam head. The smell is strong of hops. The taste hits you with a dry hop appeal with a huge hop profile. It leaves a stinging pleasant aftertaste as it journeys down the throat. I really like the uniqueness of the this American IPA profile.","1759: Standard lighter yellow pale ale here, good foamy head. Nice soft floral hop arrangement, if you like caldera, you'll be all good here. Plenty of taste in a pale, relative hefty amount of hops for style, light, ever so light toasting of the malt allows the hops to shine without making them exist in a ridiculous amount. Bitterness is sturdy, minty and metallic, but not a distraction or covering up the more delicate aspect of the beer, would say it leans to the grapefruit side of hop taste, cascade, chinook seem to be all over this one.","1816: This has recently hit the NC market...in reading reviews I' puzzled at the reviews. This is an AWESOME IPA...simply awesome. Appearance is great, cloudy with a very decent 2\" head. Smell is fresh hops and malt...more hops than malt. Taste is mostly all grapefruit hops...I love it. Right next to G'Night (Gordon) as the best beer from a can...I gave my son a can and even his collage buddies who don't like IPA's said it was amazing. The price point is a little high ($13 for a sixer) in NC but I love this brew.","1885: This is a great beer in the canned beer arena. Had no option but to drink this straight from the can so I can't comment on appearance. Had a nice scent of bitter citrus and pine. Hops contribute a moderate bitterness consisting of both grapefruit and pine flavors, on top of a lightly sweet pale malt backbone.. Mouthfeel was crisp and pleasing with generous carbonation. Had a couple of these on a hike and found them to be great for the occasion.","1907: Poured into an imperial nonic a clear copper with a great one finger sticky white head that nver really leaves,a frothy mass is there during the whole duration of the glass.Big caramel malt in the nose with subdued citric hops,a little hop oomph and it would be great.Citric and herbal hops play against a big caramel\u002fbiscuit malt base with neither getting the upper heand really.There is a little lightly roasted nuttiness in the malt profile as well.A beer thats oh so close to being stellar,just bump up the hop profile and there you go,as is its pretty good.","1414: I had this one on tap at the Horse Brass in Portland, Oregon. It came in dark orange\u002fgolden color with a good sized frothy white head that left lacing on the glass all the way down. It smelled very hoppy and sweet\u002fsour in a citrus way as well. The taste was great. Very hoppy and bitter with a kind of sweet citrus tone to it as well. Mouthfeel was good, this one has some bite and it left a dry\u002fbitter aftertaste that made my mouth water for more. Overall this is a good beer, tastes great, goes down smooth, doesn't disappoint.","1320: I had this on tap last in August of 2009 at Bailey's Taproom in Portland, Oregon. The colour was a very dark brown with a garnet base and a thin tan head. The aroma was full of coffee, roasted malt and chocolate. On the palate, there was light CO2, day old coffee, some dark chocolate and more roasted malt.","1668: On tap tonight at the Horse Brass. Nice looking orangy amber ale with a tiny white head that lasts no time, some lace left. Aroma is pleasant but nothing special ..of hops and malts with a touch or orange peel zest. The taste was exhilarating to start with the hops blending well with the orange peel falavours but after a while it bacame dullish,but themalts held throughout. Mouthfeel was rather on the thin side and average for style This is a nice beer but for once I think this would be better served quite chilled.","1705: A: Slightly hazy copper color with a slight off-white head and pretty intense lacing. S: Pine hops and a lot of caramel malts. T: Pretty fair balance between the hops and malts. Nice amount of hops upfront and then a lot of bready malts with a slightly burnt flavor to them. Crisp and pretty easy to drink. Without a doubt the best IPA I've ever had from a can.","8: Pours a nice copper \u002f amber with a medium tan lasting head and nice lacing. Aroma of earthy piney hops, followed by some caramel malt and nice fruity bouquet. Taste is resiny earthy piney hops with some nice caramel maltiness and light fruity notes. Palate is nice crisp medium body with good carbonation. Finish is sweet caramel malt with some fruitiness ending with a good hoppy bitterness. Overall a seemed a bit on the hoppy side but seems to be well balanced, a good drinkable brew.","10: A: poured a caramel brown with a thin head that left a little bit of sticky lacing on the glass. S: at first I get caramel aromas with a underlying floral hop notes which had a good malt presence. There was also some citrus and bready notes as well. T: some nice piney hops pop out on the taste with caramel and citrus grapefruit accents that help out on the bitterness. It seems to have a decent malt backbone that helps out the balance. M: medium body with a low amount of carbonation that still works out but had a slight sweet and bitter hop finish. D: pretty good IPA that drank well and had a good amount of sweetness but lacked on the hop punch. It was still a tasty brew.","61: From the can at SAVOR 2011. Pours a clear golden color with an average white head and a slight amount of white lacing on the way down. The nose brings quite a bit of citrus hop character, mostly tending toward grapefruit. Quite nice. The flavor has just a touch of malt in the background and is instead focused on a fairly-heavy hop presence. Orange and grapefruit come through and perhaps a bit of a floral character. Medium body with good bitterness. Nice and dry. Solid brew.","67: Pours a reddish orange with a thick off-white head. Lots of sticky lacing, head reduces down to nice crust. Smells of pine, grapefruit, and resinous hops. Nice hoppy flavor with citrus and pine notes. I tinge of malt as well. Medium bodied mouth feel and overall a very drinkable beer.","72: Like someone else has written this almost looked like a barleywine. A nice copper, slightly darker than I'd expect, a little thin head that leaves some lacing. Initially after the pour I took in whiffs of pine, and citrus, but after letting it settle I got more biscuit and sweet malts. Tastes like it smelled, initial hop blast that singes the tongue, then it subsides to give a biscuit\u002fmalt based finish. Overall, I'd say it tasted like a hoppy barleywine. Mouthfeel is medium to light, a bit of carbonation, but overall good. at 7% more or less, it's a decent offering","125: Thanks to Djeucalyptus for these! Poured from the can to a tulip. Fairly clear pale orange with a sticky, long lasting head. Lots of lacing. Fairly pungent resiny, piney aromas. Taste is very piney right away. Good hop bite and very crisp and clean feel. Just a great, easy drinking ipa- right up there with other great ones as far as drinkablity. Great beer!","147: Pours a really nice sunburnt orange. Subtle head is off white and minimal. Aroma - Lots of citrus, and tangy aromas, a little bit of dankness. I get clementine and tangerine, apricot, and a little peach. Flavor - solid bitterness with a crisp hop flavor. I get a good earthy flavor with a nice caramel note in the backround. Good malt backbone with biscuit and cracker dry notes. Overall- good everyday drinker IPA. Lots of hop goodness with a solid malt flavor to back it up.","158: Pours a nice clear golden pale with foamy white head. Smells nice with very apparent herbal hop aroma. Taste is smooth with a nice crackery malt flavor and a big bitter hop finish. A tad overly bitter for your typical pale ale, maybe needs a bit more malt but I still like it. Plus it comes in a can which is a GREAT thing. Go cans.","259: The first one poured with an incredibly large off white head with great retention. I was very careful the second time. Color was a hazy copper Smelled of bubble gum and citrus. Tastes like it smells, with a hint of lime. The grapefruit biterness kicks in at the end. Well carbonated, smooth, nicely balanced between malt and hops. A fine example of an American IPA. Highly recommended.","296: Appears a dark orange color with a large amount of white foam. It smells slightly of caramel, citrus and grassy hops. The smell is very well balanced you can smell both malts and hops. It tastes initially of semisweet malts the malty taste quickly goes away. A profound and flavorful hop bitterness soon follows. There is a nice citrus flavor and also a nice fruity sweetness. Overall a very solid IPA. The carbonation is moderate low. This is quite drinkable; I could drink a few of these in a row easy. An excellent IPA that is hoppy yet is balanced perfectly with semisweet malt.","323: Cloudy, brownish amber. Medium, foamy, off-white head. Some carbonation and a touch of lacing. Earthy, floral hop aroma, some bready malts. Flavor has more earthy hops, lots of bready, grainy malt. Heavy-ish body but not sweet. A nutty aftertaste. Odd for a west coast IPA; not hoppy at all but not much malt flavor or complexity going on either.","327: Served from can into a Delerium Tremens tulip. Pours a hazy red-orange with a one finger off-white head that slowly subsides to minimal. Maintains decent lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt, hops, and pine. The flavor was of malt and a load of hops. It was medium on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a very nice IPA from a can no-less. Definitely worth seeking out if you are an IPA fan as it is quite drinkable and enjoyable. I will be having another in the near future.","339: appearance - highly carbonated, boastful head (2-3 in), transparent golden amber smell - resinous hops (simcoe?) taste - highly resinous, pine, pronounced hop flavor, some sweet malts to balance it out (very subtle though) mouthfeel - high carbonation, medium body, slightly dry finish drinkability - nice big resinous hop profile, true oregon\u002fwest coast ipa, bordering on a session beer if you can handle the hops!","348: copper or amber in color. pretty clear with an off-white hop head forming on top. smells of pine up front and a hit of citrus zest toward the back. taste is refreshingly hopped. malty sweetness amongst the pine, resins, and citrus. mouthfeel is crispy with a slight bite. definetly drinkable.","388: Poured from a can into my snifter. A - A clear golden orange, slightly burnt red color body with a medium frothy light white head. S - Very nice and big citrus hop smell that is smooth and sweet. Very pleasant. T & M & D - Great fruit sweetness up front that is refreshing and almost minty cool. Then some bigger malty sweetness on mid palate and the slight fruit acidity cleans the end and brings in some slight airy floral notes. The mouth is light and very drinkable, I go back to refreshing. O - Awesome IPA and I love the can. They really pull of the style well. One of my favorites that I come back to often. -Cheers","440: Poured from the can into a tulip. Nice pour, perfect carbonation, nice medium head, solid lacing. Aroma is a perfect IPA balance of malt and citrusy piney hops. Taste matches aroma perfectly, this is a very balanced IPA. One weakness for me is the mouthfeel is the slightest bit thin. For all the flavor and aroma I would like it a bit \"chewier\". Very solid IPA.","446: A-Gold-light bronze. Big eggshell head. Brilliantly clear. S-Piney, citrusy hops. Crackers. Slight soapiness after a while. T-citrus rinds, some pine. Firm bitterness. Bitterness hides much of the malt but some crackery malt comes through. M-medium light bodied. Medium carbonation. No alcohol burn. really nice. D-Really nice beer. A bit on the bitter side to drink all night but a really tasty beer.","486: Apperance: Orange-y, light amber. Lacing left on the glass. Smell: Nice citrus hop aroma thats pretty minimal of a NW IPA, a nice chance. Taste: Malt flavor is rapidly replaced with a pretty bitter lasting hop finish. T Mouthfeel: darn easy drink.... Drinkability: Tasty beer, Id drink this again.","488: The beer pours a hazy dark golden\u002famber color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pale and Carapils scent along with a huge citrus hop aroma. There is a light breadiness as well. The taste is very good. It's light with a damn bitter hop taste. It's loaded with citrus goodness. The malt bill provides some balance, but this is a hop heavy beer. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great session IPA. It refreshingly hoppy and easily drinkable.","491: Super clear orange body with a frothy sticky head that lasts the whole beer, very impressive appearance. Smells sweet, pine, citrus, biscuity, earthy. Taste is very malty with very little bitterness which i was not expecting as this is an IPA and should have more hop profile the taste. A little too malty for my liking.","545: Pours a clear orange with a big tan head. Smells of citrus. Taste is very citrusy up front, with a nice caramel malt middle, and an herbal, smoky hop finish. Nice bitterness that clings to your tongue. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, nice low carbonation. Drinkability is great, several of these in a row wouldnt be difficult. A super choice for an IPA which conveniently comes in a can.","558: Thanks to Kegatron for hooking me up with a can. Pours a clear amber color with 3 fingers of tall foamy off-white head. Great retention leaves lots of lacing stick. Smells of caramel, pine, grapefruit, and spicy hops. Tastes of toasted grains, caramel, citrus fruits, and bitter spicy and earthy hops in the finish. Medium in body with good carbonation. Crisp and balanced with a nice woodsy bitter finish. Easy to drink and enjoyable. A solid sessionable IPA that has me looking forward to trying more stuff from Caldera.","616: Pours dark nice amberish color head. Smell is hoppy piney goodness Taste is hoppy (of course) I detected a tiny hint of citrus with followed by a nice grassy piney after taste. went down smooth and a wee bit creamy great beer to start the night out with. all and all typical Hopped out beer, but price VS quality one of the best out there.","618: Pours a nice clear and bright amber color with a decent head, and a bit of lacing. Aromas are pine like, earthy, pungent and resiny. Smells a bit funky, but not bad. Taste is crisp, biting, with some sharp brewed tea flavors up front. Hint of hard candy sweetness, and light creamy malt flavors. Finish is bitter, earthy, grassy, and dry. Mouthfeel is very good. Very full, smooth, and nicely carbonated. Overall, an interesting and tasty beer. A but different than most IPAs brewed on the West Coast, unique, and rough around the edges, but I like it.","620: Pours golden with 1 finger of eggshell white head. good head retention & lacing S: Slight lemony & grassy hop notes, plus a bit of breadyness T: Lemony & grapefruitty hops; plus a bit of honey malt up front. Some grainyness & grapefruit hops as this warms. Finishes crisp with a load of grapefruit MF: Light\u002f medium bodied with lively carbonation that really show cases the hops, for better or worse. Skews too hoppy, makes me think IPA more than APA Drinks pretty easy despite the OTT hoppyness.. still a solid APA","633: A: Pours a clear golden color, not too much head or lacing down the glass S: Grassy\u002fpiney type hop scent, nothing too fragrant though T: Mild sweetness followed by a nice crisp grassy\u002fherbal hop flavor M: Light to medium bodied, carbonation is pretty good O: This is a nice summer BBQ beer, I think i may like their amber better but this one is a decent pale.","649: A-Full bronze. big light tan head. brilliantly clear. S-Some toasty malt. Light citrus hop aroma. Not a lot going on. T-Carmelly malty. Firm bitterness but more balanced to the malt than their Pale ale. Not much in the way of hop flavor. Lots of bitterness but not much flavor. M-medium bodied. medium carbonation. No alcohol burn. D-An average tasting IPA. Needs more hop flavor and aroma. Bitterness and malt are spot on. Still not a bad beer.","650: pours a copper slight haze color with a 1 finger head..smell is citrus and pine with hops and malt..taste is the same its a pine hit first with some floral hops and sweet malts.a bitter finish in the back of the mouth..this ipa is pretty tasty if you like a pney crisp ipa with some sweet malts..i could drink a couple of these no problem..but would not be my choice of ipas when looking for one","660: Can from Beerzack. Thanks! Pours Semi-clear reddish amber witha big lasting chunky whitish head that leaves lots of lacing. Smell is sweet fruity, fresh and hoppy. Very nice. Taste is smooth with fruity caramel and fresh citrusy, and sweet orange flavored hops and bitter citrus rind. Nice and strongly bittered which lasts in the finish but with a light lingering sweetness too. Very good IPA.","661: Nice amber color with a great head and lacing, plus it's in a can! Love it when beers are in cans. It smells piney and earthy and gains in the taste. Earthy Munich malts balance with a lot of citrusy and herbal northwestern hops, with some metallic and peppery notes sneaking in to make a solid but not outstanding IPA. Slight stickiness to the mouthfeel, but very drinkable overall.","698: Appearance: Orange-amber with a slight haze to it. The eggshell colored head retains remarkably well, leaving a ton of sticky lace behind. Smell: Floral with a bit of resiny pine and grapefruit. Great hop aroma with no noticeable malt presence. Taste & mouthfeel: Malty but very dry. Floral and resiny hop flavors follow, leading way to a bitter finish with a hint of grapefruit. The medium-light body and restrained ABV make this one seriously drinkable IPA.","713: nice burnt orange with a white head that holds fairly well and leaves very pretty lace. nose and taste consist of piney, citrusy and maybe peachyish hops with a caramelly backbone. decent mouthfeel, a little thicker would be good for me, but there is no doubt this is a first class ipa. tons of competition keep the ratings down, but i could knock these back all night and be in sweet hophead bliss the whole time.","722: Nice dark orange colured ale, small lightv tan head. I dont like the aroma, it certainlly has hops aplenty, but has a sour ,sweaty work sock aroma that puts me off in the background. The flavor is better, very strong oniony hopping, pink grapefruit and spruce tips. Thin and maybe even a tad under carbonated. I dint really dig this one. I liked their Pale Ale way better.","741: I got this beer from Tilley4. Thanks Jason! 12oz can served in a standard pint glass. L - slightly hazed copper color with a bone white head that left trails of lacing. S - citrus rind and a slab of butter rolled in dirt. T - bitter citrus rind upfront with some buttery notes before getting dry and tart on the finish. F - medium bodied with a biting feel and smooth carbonation. D - goes down quick and easy.","751: A: a coppery, somewhat bronze type color with a nice thin layer of lace left atop. S: Malty and some dark fruit notes... plumb\u002ffig..but a sweet T: the malty sweentness blended with the dark fruits do make for an interesting tasting beer. M: medium bodied dark ale, relatively easy to drink... O: pretty good beer.","769: Pours out a clear, amber\u002forange with a 2-finger, thick, white head that leaves moderate, splotchy lacing. The smell is both fruity and malty, malt dominates. Taste is fruity, citrus hops up front then overtaken by a strong malt flavor and finishes with bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium, well-carbonated at first but low later. Drinkability is fine. I like it and many of those who like IPAs will also.","779: Appearance: Pours a clear, orangey-copper body with a small, bubbly white head. Smell: Aroma of caramel malts with an herbal, citrus hop presence. Taste: Mild caramel malt flavor and sweetness. Zesty citrus hops and the taste of fresh herbs. A pinch more of those caramel malts reemerge for the overall bitter finish. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Slight stickiness to the mouthfeel. Drinkability: Whaddya know, it's a fairly good IPA.","780: Copper and light red pour, standard head to it. Dry hopping nose was there, but not huge, not super awesome or anything, just a bit of subtle vegetal hop quality to it with the peat malt thing. Citrus quality comes out on the tongue. Bitterness sustains itself throughout the entire beer. Pretty much an ordinary red spruced up with some green hops, and yes, it works. Makes the ordinary a little less ordinary. Doesn't skimp on the maltiness either. Dry finish for a red. Solid stuff, would drink again, and definitely recommend to someone who likes red ales. I am not fond of them, but enjoyed this.","783: Poured from the can into a glass tumbler. Nice aroma and pale yellow appearance. Nice fluffy head and fair amount of lacing. Taste was a big surprise, I thought any beer from a can would be a let-down. The initial malt sweetness was nicely balanced by the hop bitterness. Not like an IPA for sure but impressive anyway. Mouthfeel was O.K. and drinkability was good. Made with whole flower Cascade hops.","832: Hazy apricot color with a solid frothy eggshell colored head with great retention and lacing. Visible carb at the edges. Nice floral and grapefruit hop notes on the nose. Good clean flavors. Nice mild hop notes up front with the same characteristics as the nose balanced well with the middle-backended caramel maltiness. Hops create a slightly bitter aftertaste. Mouth is crisp with a bit of a zip and high carb. Overall it's a good pale ale. A perfect beer to have in a can like it is, being a perfect beer to have while camping, golfing, fishing etc.","837: A - Poured out a slightly hazy, auburn\u002famber color with a thick, foamy, tan, two-finger head. It left some nice lace. S - It smelled of tons of pine. Sweet notes of grapefruit and orange peel. T - It was very peppery and spicy with a smooth burnt toast maltiness. Some subtle citrus flavors, too. M - It was crisp and sharp. A light to medium-bodied beer. D - This is a pretty good IPA. Here in the Midwest the price tag was a bit high, though.","883: Snagged a can of this after seeing that it's got such a positive amount of reviews. The beer poured out as a clear yellowish gold color, it has a pretty good looking soapy head on it. The lacing is a little sticky but not too much. The smell of the beer has a really nice malty and hoppy aroma. The hops smell bright and fruity. The taste of the beer was pretty good. The hops were definitely in there ready to hit ya in the mouth. The malt cleaned up the mess in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was light and refreshing. Overall it was a pretty good IPA.","891: A - pours an amber color with a two finder head that is retained for a good 5-10 minutes. The beer is almost as clear as a lager...not cloudy at all. S - very strong citrus smells. T - similar to the smells, the first predominant taste is citrusy. After that, you get a hint of caramel. Then the hops come through and leave a nice bitterness finish. D - I love this IPA. It's one of my favorites! It's exactly how a west coast IPA should taste. The only issue could be a slight lack in carbonation.... But I find that true of most craft can beer I try.","901: Pours a nice golden peach color with a frothy long lasting ivory head. Smells of earthy grassy hops and a little citrus. Great tasting with plenty of bitterness and some grapefruit. Just enough of a malt backbone to let those grassy hops shine. A medium-bodied and flavorful IPA available in a can that reminded me of a nicer version of 60 min. If the price point were lower, I'd drink this a ton.","924: A: Dark amber in color, the head was amazing. Slighly off white head, with enough retention to balance the can on it if I wanted to. S: Lots of citrus and piney hops. T: Wasn't sure what to expect from my first \"real\" can of beer. It was very well balanced. You had a good citrus and piney resin working together on this one. M\u002fD: It had good carbonation, the end was mildly bitter and oily. I thought this was a great first for me.","932: A - hazey orange in color with a rocky white head which quickly dissipates to a thin film. S - the nose is rich with hops. piney and fruity. sweet caramel malt notes and some cherry esters. T - clean, lightly sweet malt upfront followed by some piney bitterness and a long cherry\u002fsweetish finish. M - smooth, creamy, a touch watery and a full zippy carbonation. O - nice IPA with lots of piney notes but could've had a bit more bitterness on the tongue.","984: Pours a very nice golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice creamy one-finger plus off-white head, lots of nice small islands and sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, big hop note, citrus\u002fpines, and caramel. The taste is very nice, malty, hoppy, with some nice citrus\u002fpine tones, with some caramel thrown in. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very solid IPA (in a can too), definitely recommended.","989: a: This was a very pale, clear golden color. It was served to me with craggy, sticky head that stuck around for awhile. s: Big piney hop nose with a little lemon. t: This tasted very fresh. Sweet flavors of toffee and then a big piny hop blast at the end. m: Fabulous carbonation, long lasting. Perfect. d: One of the best IPAs I've tried. Great stuff.","1000: Reviewed on 1\u002f3\u002f2010. Can. Pours a clear deep orange with a thick off-white head. Aroma of piney, grassy hops, some citrus and tropical fruits. Flavor of caramel malt and light citrus upfront with a bitter hops finish. Decent IPA, rather on the bitter side.","1002: Pours a clear burned orange with a creamy head that dies somewhat quickly and little to no lacing. Smells like a hop bomb with strong citrus, rind and a tiny bit of floral. Blows away your taste buds with hops and a bite of citrus. The balance isnt as great as it could be but this sure is tasty, especially if you are a hop head. Finishes wonderfully dry and bitter but doesnt linger too long on the tongue. Carbonation is perfect. A very drinkable and delicious IPA....and from a can no less.","1004: A - Poured a copper color with a big off white head that leaves a ton of lacing behind S - Is a nose full of hops that are both citrus and piney with a touch of caramel malt kicking around T - Follows the nose hops upfront more pine than citrus with the caramel malt trying to come through to add some balance M - This beer has a medium body with higher carbonation to it D - I'm enjoying this IPA quite a bit I don't know if it coming from a can is making me like it more but this beer tastes good and is worth a try if you see it around","1009: Pours a clear gold color, with a big impressive white head. Nice hoppy cascade nose. Floral, and pine like. Beer has a pretty light quality. But is still tasty. Light crisp hop flavor, a bit of malty sweetness and creaminess, and a slightly piney and resiny hop finish. Nice simple APA. Mouthfeel is pretty good. As mentioned, it's a bit light, but still feels nice in the mouth. Drinkability is very good. Light and easy drinking, yet still a tasty APA. Session worthy. I love canned craft beer!","1019: This beer poured out as a nice golden color, almost copper. The head was fluffy and white, left behind a strong lacing too. The smell of the beer was floral and citrusy. The taste of the beer has a sweet bitterness, plenty of citrusy grapefruit flavors and a touch of malt in the back end. The mouthfeel has a good bite to it, with a dry aftertaste. Overall it's a good IPA, I am glad I tried it for sure.","1031: Tapped this open and a fruity piney smell, Cloudy golden orange color when poured in a pint glass. Nice foaming thick head. Big and hoppy, yet smooth as butter. Minimal hop after taste (I like this, so was a liittle disappointed with the lack there of there) However, a delicious beer. Would drink it anytime!! I bet on draft it is a delight!","1072: Can from K&L Redwood City. A - Pours a bright medium amber color with a two-finger, lasting off-white head and good lacing. S - Aroma is piney and citrusy hops, a touch of sweet malt, and tropical fruits. T - Flavor is a little pale and caramel malt, but mostly showcases a complex hop profile, with pine, pineapple, orange, and grapefruit. Pretty harshly bitter, although I like that of course. M - Crisp palate with medium body and carbonation. D - Solid. Overall this is the best canned IPA I've had after Surly Furious.","1073: Thanks to 5000 for sending this can my way. The beer pours a dark amber color with a white head. Darker than expected. The aroma is very nice. I get a lot of grapefruit and pine notes. The flavor is similar. The predominant flavor is some resiny pine from the hops but I also get some grapefruit. The toffee and caramel malt backbone balance out the beer nicely and keep the bitterness level fairly low for a west coast IPA. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very nice.","1126: Poured from a can into a pint glass A - Amber in color with a thick, off-white head. S - Not as much hop aroma as I had hoped. There is some citrusy hop aroma and a bit of stickiness to it. T - better hop character in the taste. Good malt backbone to balance the hops. The finish is a bit chalky and biscuity. M - The biscuitiness interferes with the mouthfeel to me. A bit too thick on the tongue for an IPA. D - Nothing unpleasant about the way this one goes down. Alcohol is well masked and the carbonation level is right where it needs to be.","1136: A- Pours a nice amber color with a whit head. S- Hops with a citrus tone hint of malt. T- Hops and citrus tones with a hint of a malt finish. M- Semi dry with hop flavors through out sip and a malt finish. D- Pretty good beer from Oregon. I can drink this again with no worries. Cheers...","1150: A: Pours a cloudy orange with a crisp white two finger head layer. S: Slightly citrusy with a bit of hops here, too. T: Malty and hoppy, but neither overpowers. Very well balanced. M: Calm and balanced flavors. D: This would be a great beer for a hot summer day. Nothing wild, but simply a good beer.","1152: A= basic blonde, mild white head, decent lacing. S= honey and floral hops notes. More evident as the beer warmed for a few minutes. T= immediately astringent and dry, somewhat watery, some florals, pine, bitters. M= astringent, some bitterness, florals. D= fine if you like it, depends on the price versus better APA offerings.","1162: Poured into a tulip glass. A light golden orange color. Very clear with almost 2 fingers of creamy rich pillowy head. This thing smells like candied hops. Lots of orange citrus covered in caramel. Tastes alot like the aroma only a bit on the lighter side. The citrus is there, the caramel is there and there is also a small amount of floral notes as well. Light to medium bodied with a crisp bitter finish. Overall this is an excellent canned IPA that i could drink all day long. Notes: Review taken from notes written on 5-25-10","1168: A: Poured a pale amber color, clear with good carbonation leaving a nice white head S: Light caramel, hops, bitterness, some citrus and floral notes T: Floral and citrus with impressive hops, def a American West Coast IPA here. M: Lighter bodied with hop bitterness leaving a crisp, bitterness D: Good. I actually thought this could have been a modest single IPA as well","1179: Pours a clear very light yellow with strong carbonation but a weak head. The aroma is sweet, non-descript malt with just a touch of grassy hops and some graininess. The flavor is quite similar with pale malt sweetness, some grassy herbal hops, clean yeast, grainy notes and a surprising amount of bitterness. I have to say that the flavor is pretty disappointing, even for this style, though the dryness does give it some merit. Mouthfeel is not just light, but watery. It has a nice dry finish and is very quaffable, and holds up alright when compared to other beers in this category, but I think there are better options.","1183: A: Deep apricot hue with a huge, beautiful, sudsy cream-colored head; lacing is great S: Lots of wonderful citrus from the hops: peach, mango, pineapple, lemon, grapefruit, and tea leaves with a slightly grassy and grainy malt undertone T: Hops are a touch more muted than aromas indicated but still plenty of citrus, tea leaves, pine, and weed F: Quite creamy upfront and finishing pretty well--though a touch thin O: A nice hop-forward IPA in a can, which you can never get enough of; something I'd like to try even fresher and something I will definitely come back to","1215: Poured from a 12 oz can into a pint glass. Pours a hazy copper color, with a very small head. Not much lacing. The aroma is very hop forward, notes of citrus. Everything good about the nose gets ramped up a notch in the taste. Huge grapefruit and orange flavors, good malt backbone and a really nice hop finish. Medium bodied, carbonation is good. An incredibly drinkable IPA, will definately seek out again!","1240: A: Pours to a frothey tan head with a deep and beautiful copper body. Excellent lacing. S: Slight, hoppy, piney aroma. T: Citrusy with piney hops. Crisp and not real bitter but it does have a slight bite with lasting flavor. The hops definitely comes through. A nice IPA that doesn't knock you over. Typically what an IPA is suppose to be. M: Lightly carbonated, smooth and thin. Not watery or oily. D: Refreshing and while not a session beer, you can easily enjoy a couple of these without any problems. One of the better canned micro-brews that I have tried.","1257: Copper colored beer with a nice sticky off-white head with some orange hues. Classic Western IPA aroma of loads of citric hops. Also some mildly herbal aromas but this beer is all about the C-hops. Well balanced yet still hoppy. Grapefruit, pinecones and fresh mint in the flavor. Medium to full bodied and wayyy too drinkable. I looked down and my glass was empty. A great IPA in a can, what's not to love. Oh yeah, we can't get it in NC that's what's not to love.","1260: A - Pours a medium amber color with a 1-2 finger head with some lacing. S - You get hit with the regular Pine and Citrus but also some sweet malt on the back end T - Flavor was thinner than some IPA's but still nice with the Pine and Citrus, almost a little too much malt on the back end for me and not as smooth as I would have hoped. M - Crisp IPA light\u002fmedium body with medium carbonation. D - Pretty Good. The best canned IPA I have had, although it was my first canned IPA. Next time I think I would rather have two Pliny's to a six pack of this.","1265: A: Yellow and clear. Nice 1 finger white head. S: Not much here. Slight Cascade hops and malt. I was a bit disappointed at first because the smell was unimpressive. T: A nice mix of the C hops. This gives a mouth full of bitter grapefruit and citrus. M: Very bitter, just like it should be. It is also quite crisp, which makes for a refreshing IPA. No alcohol burn at all. D: This is an excellent easy drinking IPA. I wish the aroma was a little more hoppy, but overall I enjoyed the brew. I am happy to find this on the shelves at my local craft beer store.","1299: Amber with hints of orange with big tan foamy head with good retention and uneven lacing. Big citrus hop aroma. Big bitter grapefruit up frony with good caramel mellowing backbone. Smooth, silky feel with a low carb feel despite the big foamy head. A good overhopped IPA that's pleasant yet slightly one dimensional. Not worth $13.50\u002f6 pack unless you really need a good IPA in a can.","1303: Appearance: Pours a hazy, yellow-orange body with a thin, wispy white head. Smell: Aroma of herbal, citrus hops accompanied by a honey-laden maltiness. Taste: Mild pale malts with a bit of toastiness and a soft honey-like sweetness. Citrus and bitter herbs. Medium bitterness. Finishes dry. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Drinkability: A fair pale ale, but I gotta say I enjoyed the Caldera IPA far, far more.","1304: Poured amber from the can. Nice one inch head with plenty of lacing. Aroma is earthy citrus hops and a bit of sweet malt. Flavor is usual hops citrus and pine in this case. Nice balance of hops and malts with hops dominating. Good mouthfeel not too watery. Amazingly good canned beer! Highly recommended if you enjoy IPA's. Try the APA also.","1325: Clear light copper. Thick offwhite head. Decent retention. Nice tight laces. Pine, floral, citrus, and spicy hop aromas. Rich toasty, mild sweet caramel and a touch of vanilla. Crisp grapefruit, floral, pine, spicy resins. Toasty sweet caramel rolls in. Piney\u002fpeppery bitterness. Smooth, semi-rich medium body. good medium carbonation. Some drying and stickiness. Great canned IPA. Very drinkable and very tasty. Tailgating and camping and grilling favorite.","1327: Pours a clean orange-ish to copper color with a light tan head. In the aroma, faint pine like hops. In the taste, mellow pine hops and a nice malt balance. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry to clean hop aftertaste. More a pale than IPA, but decent nonetheless.","1331: 12oz can poured into a pint Pours a hazy golden color with a fluffy white head. Some nice staying power and spider web lacing. The aroma is musty and earthy with layers of pine and orange. On the palate, this guy is a little more pine and citrus forward while the earthy, musty hops come through in the middle. The finish is earthy bitter with a touch of pine resin. Light medium body with good carbonation. This is a nice pale ale that deserves a spot in any rotation. Borderline sessionable.","1334: Wierd tasting IPA, thrown in a trade. Starts OK, and then residual odd hop flavours. Medium yellow body, a quarter inch of white foam. A little hop aromas. Not skunky, but just another AMerican IPA to me, with moe astringency than balance. A bit aggressive carbonation.","1411: A- Nice bright red color with a pretty foamy head. Lace is allready showing off and trying to get me to take a sip before finishing the sentance. S- Heavy citrus blend with a sweet finish. Smells like a much hoppier beer than an IPA. T- Much maltier than the nose lets on, sweeter too. I taste a lot of grain and oils. Slightly buttery. M- Truely a medium bodied sample. Not watery but definatley not full either. D- Good pick up from the store as something new. Not something I would recommend to a friend as a must try, but a maybe try for those looking to try new IPAs. Thanks Caldera...another decent brew from Oregon.","1412: A: A light orange gold, with modest tightly knit bit of head that stays. S: Nice piney, grapefruit and citrus, hint of biscuity malts T: First flavors are a strong, piney, grapefruit bite, with a tad of crystalish malts barely balancing it out, then a bitter finish of resinous west coast hops. M: Medium bodied, average carbonation, slightly sticky, cloying finish. maybe from the hops. D: Decent drinkability, though I've had much more drinkable IPA's. Still a very delicious west coast IPA well worth the try. Just probably wouldn't make this session beer.","1449: A - Pours a hazy burnt orange. A billowy 3 finger head. Average lacing. S - Big citrus aroma, caramel, hints of alcohol, dried herbs. T - Citrus hops with some strawberry fruitiness. Some floral spice in the back fades into toasted caramel malt. The malt has a nice sweetness that keeps the hops from taking over everything. The malt seems shy at first but opens up as you go. My first IPA out of a can. Very easy drinking. Good stuff!","1479: A - pours a deep rust orange with 1\u002f4 inch of white foam S - citrus and hints of piney hops T - slightly citrus hops with a major piney hop kick at the end, not overpoweringly bitter, just a really tasty treat M\u002fD - medium bodied and decent carbonation, definitely a nice IPA that I could have several of","1493: 12oz can poured into a pint glass Pours a bright yellow with nice head, very little lacing. Smells slightly hoppy, mostly wet greens. Taste is a tiny little bit of honey and a fair amount of hops, some floral. Nice bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light and effervescent. Pretty drinkable. Not as good as their IPA, I don't think.","1502: A: Nice amber color with quite an impressive head. About what you'd expect from a good IPA :) S: Very citrusy, lots of grapefruit, lemons, etc.. T: Surprisingly non-bitter. Tastes closer to an APA than an IPA. Nice clean grapefruit with a bit of bitterness on the back end (but not too much). M: Surprisingly light. Carbonation suits it perfect to keep it crisp. O: Overall pretty impressive for a beer I've never heard of. Not too hoppy, not too malty, not too bitter, just does everything pretty well (but not amazingly, admittedly).","1514: A: Pale amber in color, beutifully clear, with a nice white head. S: Sweet caramel, a slight tropical fruit flavor with a hint of pine wood. T: Sweet fruit flavor at first, followed by a nice tropical hops flavor. A bit of a malt in the back, but the hop flavor dominate. Not too bitter, just pleasantly hoppy. M: Medium bodied, slightly chewy, perhaps a little over carb'd D: Very good overall, but I would like to see a little more balance from the malty side. I think the hop profile is dead on.","1532: Pours crystal clear golden amber, yellowish thick head, chunky head that falls leaving ample lacing. Smells like cidery malt, hops seemed to be subdued, slight fruitiness. Taste is bitter up front, astringent bitterness twang, slight malt but the body is too light to carry the bitterness. Borderline metallic taste, slightest fruitiness. Not the most fantastic but something I can finish, I'd probably buy this again, as the brew isn't too heavy like some IPAs.","1538: A- Good copper amber with a head that lingers. S - Pine, tropical fruit, and caramely malt T - A balanced IPA. The hops give it a good fruity and bitter punch, but the caramel malts really give the most character and are present and linger throughout the whole experience. M - Decent carbonation, not too carbonated, and smooth mouthfeel. O - A highly sessionable and pleasant IPA!","1546: Deep dark orange in color with a one-finger tan head which lingers a second then drops away leaving a few small specks of lace. Sweet malts and oily hops rise pleasantly to the nose. Some subtle pine is mixed in. Tastes of bright fresh citrusy hops and the malt backbone does it's job evening things out well. Not as big on the hops as many other IPA's, but being that it comes in the can this one begs to be taken to the lake or to the beach as it has just enough taste to keep things interesting, and the fact that it's in a can is fookin' cool.","1548: Poured from the can into a Sam Adams \"Perfect\" pint glass. (I don't know why, but beer seems to taste better out of this glass vs a regular pint glass. Call me crazy) A - Nice dark burnt orange color, off-white head, good lacing. S - Pine, grapefruit, mango, nice!!! T - Bitter and piney upfront, with a nice grapefuit and earthy end. Well balanced. Tasty. M - Medium with medium amount of carbonation. D - High. Very tasting and refreshing. Not the hoppiest IPA out there, but well-balanced and tasty. Extremely easy to drink. Great beer. I am really starting to like these Caldera guys!","1593: The beer pours a nice yellow-orange, with a thick white head. Looks delish. Maybe its my nose, but I don't detect too much - citrusy hops with a pine undergirding. But the taste is exceptional. Wonderfully bright hops and a satisfying malt backbone. But like most west coast ipas, this is not balanced...thankfully. A hops explosion of grapefruit, spice, and pine. Awesome. This is the best IPA i've had in a can...and one of the better ones around PERIOD. Check this one out.","1623: A: Beer poured a light amber color with a orange hue and large 1\" off white head that lasted for sometime. Good lacing on the sides of the glass throughout consumption. S: Citrus, orange pith, pine, and some light caramel notes. T: As with the smell I get grapefruit, orange pith, lots of pine and some light caramel malt balance. This one is pretty hop dominate. M: Medium-light bodied, good carbonation with a drying finish. D: This beer is definately six pack worth and will be one of my camping beers from here on out.","1625: Love the IPA from these guys so I had to give this one a go... Pours a light golden yellow... Sorta hazy... Pretty decent head... Balanced aromas of malt and hops with the malts being a little more dominant... Sweet buttery malts with a slight hop finish at the end... The hops seem a bit muted here... Could have been a bit more balanced... A decent brew I guess... Not one that I will reach for again especially with the IPA available..","1627: HOPS! If you like a hoppy beer, this is for you. Pours a golden brown with a nice foamy head. Complex flavors keep you interested with citrus and fruity notes. Just enough maltiness to keep the hops from being completely overwhelming. Aroma is strong with fruity citrus notes as well.","1649: A: Poured a hazy amber color with a nice white cap S: Faded piney hops, caramel T: Caramel and faded hops battle for dominance while the metallic and old Earthy notes fight for second place. Bad. M: Medium to full body and not one I would recommend hiolding on your palate O: Poor IPA, drainpoured after two sips","1658: First micro brew for me in a can. Cool logo but with no freshness date. It pours a amber color with a nice sea foam head. The smell is strong of hops. The taste hits you with a dry hop appeal with a huge hop profile. It leaves a stinging pleasant aftertaste as it journeys down the throat. I really like the uniqueness of the this American IPA profile.","1666: 22oz bottle A- Pours a hazy amber color with an off-white head with decent retention and lacing. S- The aroma is sweet malt and some citrus notes from the centennial hops as well. The aroma is good, but a little more subdued than I was expecting. T- The taste like the aroma is smooth and malty up front with the hops coming in and lingering well into the finish. M- The mouthfeel is light bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. D- Overall, I enjoyed Hopportunity Knocks but I isn't a beer I would likely seek out again. Worth a try.","1697: appearance - light amber color, just a little darker than I expected from the nose, big frothy head. Smell - very nice hop, pine, some fruit taste - nice hoppy grapefruite taste, dry finish mouthfeel - very even, not too thin, not too chewy for a single ipa overall - solid, I doubt I will pay $12.99 again for this brew and it probably factored into my rating","1721: a- can poured into a pint, two finger off white head with nice retention, hazy tawny amber coloring. s- earthy hops, some pine, grapefruit pith, bitterness, slight malt. t- earthy, bitter grapefruit rind dominates, some pine, some lemon, tasty lingering bitterness as well. m- medium body, slick. d- good, i'd drink this again, but probably wouldn't seek out and buy. this is a solid canned craft ipa though.","1759: Standard lighter yellow pale ale here, good foamy head. Nice soft floral hop arrangement, if you like caldera, you'll be all good here. Plenty of taste in a pale, relative hefty amount of hops for style, light, ever so light toasting of the malt allows the hops to shine without making them exist in a ridiculous amount. Bitterness is sturdy, minty and metallic, but not a distraction or covering up the more delicate aspect of the beer, would say it leans to the grapefruit side of hop taste, cascade, chinook seem to be all over this one.","1764: Poured a deep copper hue with a one and a half finger foamy white head. There was good retention and lacing. The smell featured a full cereal grain, caramel and a citric hop. The taste was mainly hop driven with a grain full malt behind. Citus and pine dominated. Theouthfeel was typical of the style with a very dry finish. Overall a tasty hop driven west coast ale.","1769: Great golden color-very clear-a tad deeper in in color then some pales. Good aroma-mellow hopiness to it-sort of grassy. Great flavor-well balanced between a good level of bitterness and the malt. Really good hop flavor to it as well as the bitterness. Good body as well. Very, very drinkable beer. Almost a shame to drink it right from the can!!!! As much as I love macros I cant help but say whoo hoo great beer in a can lets go camping!!!","1776: Pours a clear, amber color. 1\u002f2 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of strong hops and slight earthy malt. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of strong hops, some sweet malt, and some earthy malt. Overall, a very tasty IPA and by far the best beer I've ever had from a can. This was practically mind blowing for me to really enjoy a canned beer. Definitely worth a try!","1789: Poured from a can into a a Chouffe Flute A-Very deep nice amber\u002fdark copper laces thick and sticky down the glass, very sexy looking in the glass. S-very floral bitter hop smell. Grapefruit notes very citrusy. T-Much like the nose great bitterness in the front middle and back. Has a nice sweet malt quality in the middle, almost like a sweeter orange flavor very subtle but adds alot. M-Medium body near perfect on the carbonation. D-Only reason this is not a 5 is the price everything else about this beer on this section is flawless.","1801: Purchased in Portland during my spring break Pacific Northwest trip, the only bottle offering I've had from Caldera. Poured is a orange hued color. This IPA tastes maltier than the ones I used to have. Drinking at near room temperature made this even maltier-tasting, which isn't necessarily bad, but to me it tastes more like an amber than an IPA. It's a good beer but not outstanding.","1811: A: pours clear, pale orange maybe some yellow. The head is about a finger and a half of off white head. The head did settle down to a thin layer and did leave a good amount of lacing. S: malt is sweet, slightly grainy. Hops are a little piny, and a little bit grassy. T: again with the sweet lightly grainy malt. Hops bring about, mostly pine, a little citrus, and even some grass to the palate. M: carbonation is tingly and nice. Otherwise it smooth on the palate. O: yet another impressive brew from a can, good balanced flavor.","1821: 12 ounce can. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a hazy amber color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention is pretty good, and there is a lot of lacing left behind on the glass. Aroma is herbal and citrusy hops, along with a bit of sweet malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, it's mostly hops with some sweet malt noticable too. There's also a nice lingering bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel\u002fbody is medium, it's slick with moderate carbonation. It's easy enough to drink. I think it's a good solid IPA. I'd buy this one again in the future.","1828: Eh. A little surprised at the rating here. Pours a copper, reddish orange. Definitely not the familiar yellowish, golden orange of most IPAs. Large off-white head. Smells faintly of pine, more strongly of ... well, citrus. Not quite grapefruit, just citrus-y. And there's maybe a whiff of malt. Well, maybe not. There's a strange toasted after-taste to the malt, and the hop flavoring is a touch muted. Really more like a pale ale than an ipa to me, though not quite that either. Some grapefruit, some random-y citrus notes, and a touch of sweet malt. Decent, but nothing to write home about.","1855: Good IPA and in a can!!! Pours a light amber\u002fgolden clear color with a medium sized frothy white head. Average retention and thick rings of lacing. Smell includes piney and citrus hops. Prominent and good. Tastes good as well. Piney and citrus hops and enough malt to be able to say balanced. The hops win out and the beer is still bitter but also smooth, crisp and easy to drink. Mouthfeel is crisp and starts out a bit thin. But like many IPAs, the hops coat the tongue and make the beer appear more rich. Drinkability is good. Good tasting, balanced and smooth.","1856: Sampled from a can with no freshness date. Big billowy off-white head with decent retention. Burnt orange in color. Medium bodied with an oily feel and aggressive carbonation. Solid caramel malty aroma with a hint of citrusy grapfruit hop flavor near the finish. Orange citrus flavores up front that transitions to bitter pine hop flavor that quickly follows thru the middle and to the finish. Noce caramel malt undertone throughout. Decent hop character and balance but lacked the hop intensity of a really goof IPA.","1859: Thanks to bman1113vr for sharing this bottle. The beer pours a clear brown color with a tan head. The aroma is heavy on the toffee and not too much else. The flavor is toffee, leather, tobacco, wood and dark fruit. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A decent beer but nothing too exciting.","1905: Clear dark amber with a good three finger white head. Plentiful lacings. Aroma is fruity citrus hops with a bit of leather. Taste is full deep leathery bitter hops with the correct amount of malts. The label describes \"centennial hops\" as the mainstay of all that bitterness. Mouthfeel is just right, and drinkability is very good for this style. Kudos to Caldera for daring to bottle a limited production beer. Their normal regimen is cans. Cool label. Give the fellows from the \"State of Jefferson\" a big thumbs up! Keep it coming Caldera!","1907: Poured into an imperial nonic a clear copper with a great one finger sticky white head that nver really leaves,a frothy mass is there during the whole duration of the glass.Big caramel malt in the nose with subdued citric hops,a little hop oomph and it would be great.Citric and herbal hops play against a big caramel\u002fbiscuit malt base with neither getting the upper heand really.There is a little lightly roasted nuttiness in the malt profile as well.A beer thats oh so close to being stellar,just bump up the hop profile and there you go,as is its pretty good.","1916: Thanks Woody! Poured a very orange\u002fcopper brew with 1 finger of head that faded quickly leaving decent lacing. Smell was light citrusy\u002fpine hop combo. Taste was bigger on the pine but accented with nicely with citrus Mouthfeel was medium to full nice and chewy for an IPA Drinkability is good something you could put a few back of and relax with nothing that made me go WOW I need to get this again though.","1940: Reddish amber with good clarity. Modest head that leaves light lacing. Pretty color, but fairly unusual for an IPA. Pleasant nose but more malty than hoppy - graham cracker maybe? Herbal hop character with moderate lingering bitterness. A bit metallic. Medium bodied. A bit juicy but metallic bitterness builds to dominate the impression.","1894: Almost totally black. Beige foam, quite compact, not bad. Light smell, just a bit of roast, and some hop. A bit too light. The taste is light oo, and drinkable, with some malt, roast, hints of coffee. Nothing exceptional, but after all drinkable and pleasant. Light to average body. In the aftertaste some dust, somr roast, hint of caramel, and a bit of bitterness. No defect, drinkable, not bad.","324: Pours an opaque black with a 3 inch puffy khaki head that settles to a small cap. A nice latticework of lacing forms on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, dark chocolate, and alcohol. Taste is of dark roasted malt, coffee beans, and cocoa powder. A mild roasty bitterness sticks around after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp but smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good RIS with a nice balance of aromas and flavors. This one took me by surprise.","360: A- black with thin tan head. Good lace S- sweet, slight hint of esters\u002ffruit, roasted malt...typical porter nose T- similar to nose. Initial slight estery\u002ffruitiness transitions smoothly to roasty-sweet, coffee\u002fchocolate finish. One of the best balances of hops-malt I've had in a porter. M- full bodied, silky and slightly creamy. Perfect for the style. D- very sessionable....very close to perfect for the style","465: Golden yellow color. White, compact foam, quite creamy. Good appearance. Fresh smell, with good hop. Quite dry, with a good grassy note. Hay. Fresh and pleasant. More sweet in the mouth, with honey. The hop comes back in the end, and in the aftertaste. Not bad, but a bit too sweet for a pils. In the end some vanilla and camomile note. In the aftertaste, too. Though the hop, a bit too sweet. Honest.","1001: Pours pitch black with 1\u002f2\" of foamy, brown head. Great retention. Smells of roasted malts, a little coffee, and a little chocolate. Taste is similar to the nose in some respects but far more complex. Deep roasted malts and hint of coffee up front followed by a rich chocolatiness in the finish; just a hint of alcohol esters in there as well. A few more sips reveals a little toffee and some dark fruits; alcohol becomes more prevalent as the beer warms but doesn't detract from the flavor or drinkability. Mouthfeel is smooth, rich, and surprisingly, dangerously drinkable.","1231: Pours golden with a medium sized white foam. Retention is okay, but lacing sticks well. Aroma is bready, somewhat malty, and hoppy. Piney and citrusy. Bready, biscuity, malty with a hop character in the finish. The breadyness makes this almost \"buttery\" in texture. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium and creamy. Carbonation is okay. Drinkability is rather high...lower ABV, great mouthfeel, good taste.","1254: A: Poured a dark black with good carbonation and nice brown cap S: Loads of cocoa powder, coffee, dark chcolate and hints of funk\u002fsour T: Dark chocolate upfront with a booze sting, bakers powder cocoa, coffee beans, light funk going on M: Bitter chocolate at the end, booze, big body, well carbonated D: Good","1436: Brown in color, somewhere between a porter and a brown ale. Lacking in aroma, but no off stuff. Same with the taste, lacking flavor, complexity, just went with smoothness. No off flavors though, so I can't say this is bad, just unadventurous, especially for Caldera, whom I think is generally underrated. You really have to search to pull anything out of this in terms of the usual chocolate\u002fcoffee flavors, really, the only thing I can tell is that the oats did their job, because this is smooth and unoffensive. Other than that, extremely pedestrian.","1564: Dark red color, light beige foam, average. In the smell malt and caramel, not really light. Again malt and caramel in the taste, not bad in the end. Maybe a note of honey in teh back, and a light fruitiness. Average body. In the aftertaste a light bitterness, with the malt and red fruit. Nothing exceptional, but not bad, drinkable beer.","1695: A lot of foam. But a lot. In the smell some banana, and then lactic and tart. Not a good start. Quite dark orange in color, with a lively carbonation (now visible, under the foam). Again tending to lactic sourness. Same for the taste. With some yeast and banana.","1971: Served in a pint glass This beer pours a blackness with a beige foam head. The smell while not greatly profound does carry notes of blackened malts and bitter coffee. There is a touch of licorice in the nose as well. The taste mostly reminds of a bad cup of coffee. There is a distinct coffee flavor but mostly it's backed up by a burnt char flavor that lasts into the aftertaste. There is a nice medium sticky mouthfeel to the beer as well. It's drinkable, but only as it warms to room temperature. The only bitterness that I really can't get past is a burnt bitterness and it's pretty palatable in this beer and is really the only reason I was not too fond of it.","18: Pours a slightly hazy copper color with about one and a half fingers of creamy, white colored, head that has great retention. Aroma is of caramel, grapefruit, herbal hops, and toasted grain. This is a very hoppy beer. Lots of citrus and pine are present. A touch of caramel is in the background. There is a sharp lingering bitterness on the finish. Medium bodied and an easy drinker. A very nice IPA and its made even nice by the fact it comes in a can. Perfect for a round of golf or other outside activities.","8: Pours a nice copper \u002f amber with a medium tan lasting head and nice lacing. Aroma of earthy piney hops, followed by some caramel malt and nice fruity bouquet. Taste is resiny earthy piney hops with some nice caramel maltiness and light fruity notes. Palate is nice crisp medium body with good carbonation. Finish is sweet caramel malt with some fruitiness ending with a good hoppy bitterness. Overall a seemed a bit on the hoppy side but seems to be well balanced, a good drinkable brew.","10: A: poured a caramel brown with a thin head that left a little bit of sticky lacing on the glass. S: at first I get caramel aromas with a underlying floral hop notes which had a good malt presence. There was also some citrus and bready notes as well. T: some nice piney hops pop out on the taste with caramel and citrus grapefruit accents that help out on the bitterness. It seems to have a decent malt backbone that helps out the balance. M: medium body with a low amount of carbonation that still works out but had a slight sweet and bitter hop finish. D: pretty good IPA that drank well and had a good amount of sweetness but lacked on the hop punch. It was still a tasty brew.","39: A can picked up in Baltimore. Pours a clear amber color with lots of foamy off-white head. Good retention leaves some spotty lacing. Smells of grassy hops, bread, caramel, and earth. Tastes of bread, toasted grains, caramel, lite citrus, and an earthy and grassy finish. Medium in body with good carbonation. Clean and smooth, malty and grainy with a nice bitter finish. Refreshing and easy to drink, a nice canned amber ale that I would definitely enjoy while out and about in the Summer time.","43: Had this on 2011-09-23 in Lynchburg, VA A - Almost clear, orange-amber with a 2-finger off-white head with big bubbles and moderate lacing. S - Fairly strong aroma that can be smelled 18\" away. Sweet malt, citrus and hop floral. T - Much like the aroma. Sweet bread and fruit followed by a dash of orange flesh a touch of spice and finally orange rind bitterness doesn't dominate. A pleasant, well-balanced bitter-sweet taste although it doesn't blow my hair back. M - Medium body and carbonation. A bit syrupy with some prickle O - I enjoyed this brew. It has a lot of flavor for being 6.1% ABV.","57: Again folks, I do enjoy a fruit beer every now and then, and this was a pretty decent brew, just not a stand out. A - pours an average reddish gold hue with light carbonation and a thin head S - Actually nice on the nose, delicate perfume with ginger, honey, and flowers up front. T - Pretty good, though nothing special, kind of girly, but would be nice to drink at the pool or beach M - light bodied and lacks stuffing, lots of acidity up front D - gets rather boring and a little too tedious after the first few sips.","61: From the can at SAVOR 2011. Pours a clear golden color with an average white head and a slight amount of white lacing on the way down. The nose brings quite a bit of citrus hop character, mostly tending toward grapefruit. Quite nice. The flavor has just a touch of malt in the background and is instead focused on a fairly-heavy hop presence. Orange and grapefruit come through and perhaps a bit of a floral character. Medium body with good bitterness. Nice and dry. Solid brew.","64: Can. Great for shooting empty bottles in the desert. Orange color. Yummy dry hop aroma, fruity too. Good taste, not tongue numbing hops or bitterness, just the right amount for an active outdoor lifestyle for this ipa. Right amount of sweetness. Not heavy on the palate at all. Good summer ipa. Nothing outlandish mouthfeel wise. $10 a 6 was difficult at first, but seems to be a decent price after all.","67: Pours a reddish orange with a thick off-white head. Lots of sticky lacing, head reduces down to nice crust. Smells of pine, grapefruit, and resinous hops. Nice hoppy flavor with citrus and pine notes. I tinge of malt as well. Medium bodied mouth feel and overall a very drinkable beer.","72: Like someone else has written this almost looked like a barleywine. A nice copper, slightly darker than I'd expect, a little thin head that leaves some lacing. Initially after the pour I took in whiffs of pine, and citrus, but after letting it settle I got more biscuit and sweet malts. Tastes like it smelled, initial hop blast that singes the tongue, then it subsides to give a biscuit\u002fmalt based finish. Overall, I'd say it tasted like a hoppy barleywine. Mouthfeel is medium to light, a bit of carbonation, but overall good. at 7% more or less, it's a decent offering","73: Pours jet black with a thinner well retained deep mocha colored head,even when held to the light there isnt much to be seen thru the glass.Molasses and dark fruit dominate the nose along with dark coffee roast.Heavy roast and molasses flavors at the onset when the dark fruit comes into play,a big earthy almost raw finish.This is a nice American impy stout,a little raw with full flavor packed in.","74: 12oz can poured into a pint glass. Pours an orangish amber color with a sticky off-white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. The aroma features a good dose of toasted and biscuity malt with some piney hops. The taste is sweet malt up front with a lingering piney hop bitterness in the finish. Overall, Caldera IPA is another solid PNW IPA that packs the hops. Recommended.","81: Thanks to hopdog for this... Appears a hazy, light orange with a small white head that fades into a mild collar and film. Spotty lacing is left around the glass. Smell is nice of citrusy hops, along with some notes of pine sap and herbs. Taste is of the mentioned aromas with caramel and citrus notes battling it out with a mild spiciness going on in the flavor. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, yeasty, sweet up front, and bitter on the end.","82: From a can an aggressive pour into a chalice. Looks nice. Dark golden clear color with a decent head. Lace layers nicely on the side of the glass. Aroma is very pleasing building anticipation and expectations. The taste isn't quite there however. The citrus is there - to a fault. A little too bitter with an unpleasing aftertaste. It's good, just not quite ready for the big time. With all the great beers Oregon has to offer the competition is too tough to rate this beer among the best. If they smooth out the edges with a little balance this can be a great beer.","88: 12oz can poured into a pint glass Pours a pretty amber-golden with a nice head a very pretty lacing. Smells delicious -- fresh and hoppy, citrus and floral and more hoppy. Taste is some honey up front and floral throughout with a strong hoppy bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, very slightly filmy, very slightly sticky. Very drinkable. Very pleasant. Nice to have a good beer in a can for those occasions where you can't use glass.","102: 12 oz bottle poured into Sam Adams glass. Good head and lacing, pours a deep amber. Aroma is citrus piney hops, with a bit of toffee. Taste has a great hop profile, bitter piney yet plenty of flavorful citrus fruit as well. Dry finish, medium viscosity. Overall a very nice west coast style IPA.","103: Pours a dark amber with a moderate head. Smell is pretty nice! Pine and tropical fruits. Taste starts with a nice blend of bitter pine and fruit punch, without being overly sweet. Pretty dry finish, medium-light mouth. This is a nice little surprise and drinkable but not complex enough to be interesting beyond one. But overall for what it is, Caldera has a winner.","120: 12 oz. can into duvel tulip glass appearance: looks good ruby\u002forange\u002fstrawlike color with some heavy headiness, definitely dissipating though, doesnt look too carbonated smell\u002ftaste: smelling some fruitiness and some hops also and some malty balanced undertones. the taste is hoppy and not overbearing, kind of not full bodied enough. a different one this is mf: not really slick or thick just a runny ipa drink: could drink a few my first offering from caldera, ill have to try some more flavors","121: A - Pours a clear light yellow with 3 fingers foamy white head. Lots of carbonation bubbles. S - Very nice malt aroma with floral and citrus hop aromas mixing nicely. T - Taste follows the smell with floral, citrus hop notes, mild bitterness, very rich caramel malt base. M - Light bodied, lots of carbonation, finish is all bittering hops. D - Good drinkability, very smooth and the flavors work well together.","124: I love the color of this beer. Can. It feels good to look at it. Smells like a can with some sticky green herbals inside. It tastes like sticky green goodness with just a pinch of grapefruit. medium bodied, with mellow carbonation that helps tickle the grainy and lemony finish on the roof of the mouth and middle of the tongue. This guy at work gave me one, and this other guy stole it, then the first guy gave me another one. Boy am I glad.","125: Thanks to Djeucalyptus for these! Poured from the can to a tulip. Fairly clear pale orange with a sticky, long lasting head. Lots of lacing. Fairly pungent resiny, piney aromas. Taste is very piney right away. Good hop bite and very crisp and clean feel. Just a great, easy drinking ipa- right up there with other great ones as far as drinkablity. Great beer!","144: Appearance. Slightly hazy, deep amber with a two finger, off-white head. Smell. Lemon and orange rinds with a little herbal earthyness Taste. Bitter pink grapefruit with a good hit of caramel malt, A little acrid on the tongue but turns into a nice bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel. Medium-strong carbonation. A little thin and a little warm alcohol. Drinkability. A good drinker. Seems a bit acidic, but a good long hoppy finish keeps me gulping this one down.","147: Pours a really nice sunburnt orange. Subtle head is off white and minimal. Aroma - Lots of citrus, and tangy aromas, a little bit of dankness. I get clementine and tangerine, apricot, and a little peach. Flavor - solid bitterness with a crisp hop flavor. I get a good earthy flavor with a nice caramel note in the backround. Good malt backbone with biscuit and cracker dry notes. Overall- good everyday drinker IPA. Lots of hop goodness with a solid malt flavor to back it up.","149: On tap at the EOU faculty lounge in The Big. Light orange body under one finger slowly dissapating white head, exceptional lacing. Floral hops in the nose with light sweetness of malt, not too sweet. A very nice balance of grassy, grapefruit hops with delicate malty overtones on the taste buds. Nice carbonation in mouthfeel, and a very drinkable brew. A very pleasant surprise, looking forward to trying this in cans on a hot summer day.","158: Pours a nice clear golden pale with foamy white head. Smells nice with very apparent herbal hop aroma. Taste is smooth with a nice crackery malt flavor and a big bitter hop finish. A tad overly bitter for your typical pale ale, maybe needs a bit more malt but I still like it. Plus it comes in a can which is a GREAT thing. Go cans.","173: Very cloudy dark orange body is opaque. Two fingers of slighty rocky, mostly level white foam. Very piney aroma, with a bit of biscuit and a faint whiff of cleanser. Big swath of sweetness splatters across the tongue. Mix of hop tastes follows - grapefruit citrus, earthy, pine. Medium plus mouthfeel. Ok drinkability. An ok but unexceptional IPA or IIPA. No date to be found, so unless I encounter one I know to be very fresh, I won't be revisiting.","188: The beer pours a nice gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a solid pale malt scent with some bisquity notes and a mild citrus hop aroma. There is a creamy\u002fbready character to it. The taste is good as well. It has a good hop bite up front along with a balance of pale and bisquit malts. It's quite a hoppy APA. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinking pale ale. It's crisp and bitter and very enjoyable.","196: Poured a very pale yellow. No head whatsoever. Some bready aroma, but very light. Very faint lemony flavor. Extremely light malt flavors that finished with a distinct light beer aftertaste. This beer shoud've been labeled as a light beer. Shame on me for buying a lager with an ABV less than 4. Almost any mass produced light beer is better than this one. I even drank it after mowing my lawn. Should've had a tall glass of water.","210: Thanks to Flexabull to sending me this one out in the vet BIF. I like canned brews that are good and this one fit the bill. Can poured into a strain pint glass produced a nice amount of white head that settled to a lace. The body was clear golden amber in color This brew had plenty of floral hops aromas coming from the glass I could tell this was a west coat brew. The flavor was very hop forward too. I think it was extremely close to an IPA in my book, but I have noticed more and more of the APA's heading in that direction. It was crisp and light in the mouth. The brew was quite enjoyable to drink and I easily could have drank a six pack at a BBQ","213: A 12 ounce can picked up at Abe's as part of my mixed sixer. Cracked open and poured into my Tregs shaker glass. The pale ale appears a clear pale golden yellow color with about a finger of off white foam. The head leaves a thin lace on the glass with each sip. The nose and flavors consist of toasted bread, crackers and biscuits, pine, lemon, sweet malt. Decent body for the style with adequate carbonation. Pretty tasty overall.","227: Pours an orangy amber. White head. Sweet Bread notes with ultra ripe fruit on the nose. Hops are restrained here. Citrus with ripe tropical fruit. Pleasantly hopped and not overwhelming. Tasty with a long aftertaste. A solid, drinkable ipa. Perfect for summer.","242: Big thanks to G311 for this one. A - Nice big IPA appearance: deep amber with a rich head, though lesser retention and lace. S - Really a very muted nose. It is nearly astoundingly so. T - The taste is quite a bit more, well, existent... because there is really nothing but a ghost of and IPA there in the aroma dept. A bit floral and grassy, and some caramel; tastes good, just not exceptional. M - IPA. A little flaccid. D - Doesn't measure up to the Red Racer IPA that preceded it (not that it was world-class, either). Probably not even as good as the regular Caldera IPA.","248: a: dark brown with amber highlights, no head or lacing. s: dark malts, medicine, little orange and rubbing alochol. t: malts, caramel, no medicine but dark fruits, other than bitters no other orange taste detected. m: full body with some bitterness. o: worth trying once, dont think i'll seek this one out again.","252: 12oz can poured into a pint glass. A - Clear copper\u002forange with eggshell head that left a little lacing. S - Slightly nutty, floral hops, a little malt sweetness. T - A nutty\u002fslightly sweet richness that fades into citrus\u002ffloral bitterness. M - Medium\u002fLight, silky. D - High, the silky mouthfeel is not only adds to the taste, but also makes this go down real easy. Very nice, everyday drinking beer. Could give Mirror Pond a run for my \"fridge beer\"","254: Pour was a surprisingly murky yet bright caramel color with an aggressive, sticky head. Big hops flavor up front - broadly bitter with floral and herbal notes, finishing up with a bit of pine resin. Substantial malt flavor, leaning toward caramel malt and a bit of toffee. Mouthfeel was almost chewy - no one will accuse this beer of being overly filtered.","255: Awsome yellow can caught my eye. Bought at the Sacramento Co-op which is behind my house. a: I drank the first two out of the can. For some reason I really like drinking out of a can. Pours a nices light brown color in to a pint glass. Has a full head. s: Leans on the bisquity side. I'm feeling Nectar IPA here. Good, dirty, malty nose taste: Really nice bend of malts and hops here. Again can't help but think of nectar IPA, one of my favorites. This beer hits the spot with that wonderful mix of malt and hop flavors. m and d: The drinkablity is great due to the light mouth feel on this beer.","259: The first one poured with an incredibly large off white head with great retention. I was very careful the second time. Color was a hazy copper Smelled of bubble gum and citrus. Tastes like it smells, with a hint of lime. The grapefruit biterness kicks in at the end. Well carbonated, smooth, nicely balanced between malt and hops. A fine example of an American IPA. Highly recommended.","266: Lovely orange-tan color, great lasting head, and plenty of lacing. A nice biscuit-malt aroma with crisp, fresh hops. Tastes like a great malty background with delectable hoppy bitter flavors dancing on your tongue. No shortage of pine or grapefruit either. Very balanced and flavorful. Easy to drink, with a good blend of ingredients producing a rich, smooth beer creation. Definitely a likable brew.","272: Poured into a 1\u002f2 liter stein a deep rich amber\u002fbronze with a fluffy one finger head that took its time fading.Sweet smoke,brown,sugar,a bit of alcohol in the nose,mellow and sweetish,I found it appetizing.Cherry wood sweetness and light peppery spice in the nose,its gentle sweet smoke instead of in your face,mellow but assertive enough.A real nice smoked bock beer,I will grab a few of these this fall while eating alot of smoked meat off my smoker.","281: Received this can through Beer Powerball. I am really sorry that I don't know who sent it, my brother is keeping those records, but THANK YOU!! Pours with a nice half centimeter white fluffy head on a glass of dark straw-colored beer. Smells of citrusy hoppy goodness and oddly, a little like soap. Mouthfeel is very pleasant as is taste. This is a nice drinking beer. It's not blow you away with over-the-top flavor. It's a well-balanced, highly drinkable and enjoyable brew. I'm glad to have gotten the chance to try it.","282: Served from a can into a pint glass. Appears orange with a touch of gold. Foamy head present. Smell is underwhelming. Don't puck up too much on the hops front. Taste is good. There's sone hops with a tasty malt balance. Mouthfeel is creamy and full. Nice! Overall a pretty hoof experience. I'd have this again.","296: Appears a dark orange color with a large amount of white foam. It smells slightly of caramel, citrus and grassy hops. The smell is very well balanced you can smell both malts and hops. It tastes initially of semisweet malts the malty taste quickly goes away. A profound and flavorful hop bitterness soon follows. There is a nice citrus flavor and also a nice fruity sweetness. Overall a very solid IPA. The carbonation is moderate low. This is quite drinkable; I could drink a few of these in a row easy. An excellent IPA that is hoppy yet is balanced perfectly with semisweet malt.","305: Poured from a 12 oz can to a pint glass the liquid is yellow with good carbonation. The head is almost 2 fingers white and leaves good lace. The smell is real nice sweet piney and citrus notes. The taste follows, piney citrus notes, and a bready malt that is quite good. The mouthfeel is also nice, crisp and clean, smooth and a good body, the carbonation is real good. The drinkability is good, a easy drinking brew, wroth a try. Prosit, MK","312: This bottle was hand delivered from my brother who lives in Portland, OR. The beers pours a deep burnt orange color with a small white head. Very nice lacing on the glass. The dominant smell is of sweet caramel. Taste is also sweet caramel with a strong earthly, almost dirty, hop finish that hangs! A decent beer, but much more malty than I would expect from a beer called Hopportunity Knocks.","323: Cloudy, brownish amber. Medium, foamy, off-white head. Some carbonation and a touch of lacing. Earthy, floral hop aroma, some bready malts. Flavor has more earthy hops, lots of bready, grainy malt. Heavy-ish body but not sweet. A nutty aftertaste. Odd for a west coast IPA; not hoppy at all but not much malt flavor or complexity going on either.","324: Pours an opaque black with a 3 inch puffy khaki head that settles to a small cap. A nice latticework of lacing forms on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, dark chocolate, and alcohol. Taste is of dark roasted malt, coffee beans, and cocoa powder. A mild roasty bitterness sticks around after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp but smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good RIS with a nice balance of aromas and flavors. This one took me by surprise.","327: Served from can into a Delerium Tremens tulip. Pours a hazy red-orange with a one finger off-white head that slowly subsides to minimal. Maintains decent lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt, hops, and pine. The flavor was of malt and a load of hops. It was medium on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a very nice IPA from a can no-less. Definitely worth seeking out if you are an IPA fan as it is quite drinkable and enjoyable. I will be having another in the near future.","339: appearance - highly carbonated, boastful head (2-3 in), transparent golden amber smell - resinous hops (simcoe?) taste - highly resinous, pine, pronounced hop flavor, some sweet malts to balance it out (very subtle though) mouthfeel - high carbonation, medium body, slightly dry finish drinkability - nice big resinous hop profile, true oregon\u002fwest coast ipa, bordering on a session beer if you can handle the hops!","342: Poured a slightly cloudy deep amber\u002fred color with a thin soap ring of head. The smell is amazing, big bacony smoked pork Rauch goodness. The taste follows the flavors nicely with a big smoked malt flavor with a nice bit of underlying sweetness, very pork like and very flavorful. Has a nice light bitterness in the finish that helps even it out very well. The mouthfeel is very slick and oily. Great Rauchbier!","348: copper or amber in color. pretty clear with an off-white hop head forming on top. smells of pine up front and a hit of citrus zest toward the back. taste is refreshingly hopped. malty sweetness amongst the pine, resins, and citrus. mouthfeel is crispy with a slight bite. definetly drinkable.","352: A 22 ounce bomber bottle picked up at Abe's for $5 and change. Uncapped and poured into my Imperial nonic pint glass. Appears a crystal clear deep copper color with a good inch of sticky off white foam. The head leaves a thick lace in its wake. Nose and flavors are of caramel malt, white and red grapefruit peel, pith, and juice, plenty of floral notes, some other citrus such as orange and lemon, a good amount of bitterness here. Medium in both body and carbonation with a lingering bitter finish. Fans of Centennial hops should check this one out.","360: A- black with thin tan head. Good lace S- sweet, slight hint of esters\u002ffruit, roasted malt...typical porter nose T- similar to nose. Initial slight estery\u002ffruitiness transitions smoothly to roasty-sweet, coffee\u002fchocolate finish. One of the best balances of hops-malt I've had in a porter. M- full bodied, silky and slightly creamy. Perfect for the style. D- very sessionable....very close to perfect for the style","373: 22oz bottle split into two large snifters Pours black with no head. Tiny quantities of bubbles drifting along in a lonely fashion. Smells like licorice and liquor. Taste is very pleasing. Licorice and coffee roasty malts mix together with some bitter burnt toast and nice malty sweetness for a very nice flavor. Mouthfeel is thick, a little gritty, slightly dry. Overall, forgiven for apparent flatness. It's good.","388: Poured from a can into my snifter. A - A clear golden orange, slightly burnt red color body with a medium frothy light white head. S - Very nice and big citrus hop smell that is smooth and sweet. Very pleasant. T & M & D - Great fruit sweetness up front that is refreshing and almost minty cool. Then some bigger malty sweetness on mid palate and the slight fruit acidity cleans the end and brings in some slight airy floral notes. The mouth is light and very drinkable, I go back to refreshing. O - Awesome IPA and I love the can. They really pull of the style well. One of my favorites that I come back to often. -Cheers","394: 12oz can. Poured a light to medium and slightly hazy golden color with a smaller sized off white head. Aromas of grass, wet hay, citrus and a little fruity. Tastes of citrus, grain, and fruits.

Faintly hazy golden orange color. Citric and buttery toffee aroma. Grapefruit pithiness to start and throughout. Moderate caramel and toastiness. Somewhat buttery (A is ok with that in an IPA). Bittersweet lingering aftertaste. Moderate ethnanol. Medium body. Just don't like the butteriness in IPAs...","423: Light orange body under one finger slowly dissapating white head, exceptional lacing. Floral hops in the nose with light sweetness of malt, not too sweet. A very nice balance of grassy, grapefruit hops with delicate malty overtones on the taste buds. Nice carbonation in mouthfeel, and a very drinkable brew. A very pleasant surprise, looking forward to trying this in cans on a hot summer day.","426: Pours a reddish brown. Fairly clear with a bit of white head. Smells orange heavy and sweet dark carmels malts. Vry rich and dark . Brown sugar sweetness. Almost a burnt caramel on he tongue, the orange is not as strong as i would like. Thick and full bodied. Overall very nice compared to what I expected","440: Poured from the can into a tulip. Nice pour, perfect carbonation, nice medium head, solid lacing. Aroma is a perfect IPA balance of malt and citrusy piney hops. Taste matches aroma perfectly, this is a very balanced IPA. One weakness for me is the mouthfeel is the slightest bit thin. For all the flavor and aroma I would like it a bit \"chewier\". Very solid IPA.","441: Thanks to fellow BA Roger for giving me this can the other night,poured into a standard pint glass a lighter pale golden with a thinner white head that left minmimal lace as it settled quickly.Fresh cascade hop aroams pine and leafy with a bit of firm biscuit malt,again fresh hoppy flavors quit citric and subdued pine with that firm lightly sweet biscuit\u002fcaramel base.An old school left coast pale here alot of hop flavor with a dose of lightly sweet malt,solid.","446: A-Gold-light bronze. Big eggshell head. Brilliantly clear. S-Piney, citrusy hops. Crackers. Slight soapiness after a while. T-citrus rinds, some pine. Firm bitterness. Bitterness hides much of the malt but some crackery malt comes through. M-medium light bodied. Medium carbonation. No alcohol burn. really nice. D-Really nice beer. A bit on the bitter side to drink all night but a really tasty beer.","465: Golden yellow color. White, compact foam, quite creamy. Good appearance. Fresh smell, with good hop. Quite dry, with a good grassy note. Hay. Fresh and pleasant. More sweet in the mouth, with honey. The hop comes back in the end, and in the aftertaste. Not bad, but a bit too sweet for a pils. In the end some vanilla and camomile note. In the aftertaste, too. Though the hop, a bit too sweet. Honest.","483: Pours a very pale straw yello color with frothy white head, quickly dicipating but decent lacing. Smell is dominated by piney, earthy hops with a presence of citrus and floral. Pale straw like malts. Taste is a mirror of these scents, not much complexity, but good. Medium bodied, adequate carbonation. Definitely a refreshing, milder alternative to many pale ales currently out there.","486: Apperance: Orange-y, light amber. Lacing left on the glass. Smell: Nice citrus hop aroma thats pretty minimal of a NW IPA, a nice chance. Taste: Malt flavor is rapidly replaced with a pretty bitter lasting hop finish. T Mouthfeel: darn easy drink.... Drinkability: Tasty beer, Id drink this again.","488: The beer pours a hazy dark golden\u002famber color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pale and Carapils scent along with a huge citrus hop aroma. There is a light breadiness as well. The taste is very good. It's light with a damn bitter hop taste. It's loaded with citrus goodness. The malt bill provides some balance, but this is a hop heavy beer. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great session IPA. It refreshingly hoppy and easily drinkable.","491: Super clear orange body with a frothy sticky head that lasts the whole beer, very impressive appearance. Smells sweet, pine, citrus, biscuity, earthy. Taste is very malty with very little bitterness which i was not expecting as this is an IPA and should have more hop profile the taste. A little too malty for my liking.","521: Pours orange-gold with a two-finger head. Decent retention. Nice lacing. Nice carbonation. Nice pine aroma. Some grapefruit-pineapple to the nose as well but mainly pine. Very nice flavor. Slightly roasted dry finish with just a twinge of fruitiness. Excellent bitters all the way through. Slightly thin feel, though. Overall, very nice.","545: Pours a clear orange with a big tan head. Smells of citrus. Taste is very citrusy up front, with a nice caramel malt middle, and an herbal, smoky hop finish. Nice bitterness that clings to your tongue. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, nice low carbonation. Drinkability is great, several of these in a row wouldnt be difficult. A super choice for an IPA which conveniently comes in a can.","549: Suprised by the hoppy taste from this can. Consumed at a bar called the Tin Can in St. Louis. Citrus notes in the initial smell gives way to a hoppy and well carbonated first drink. I also pick up a little banana aroma. I drank this brew straight from the can which probably didn't assist the experience but it us definitely a drinkable ipa. As previously stated it is quite hoppy for a can which is refreshing. I am not able to get this at home so I am glad that I tried it.","552: A: Very pale golden color with pretty much no head whatsoever. S: Kind of weird but a little intriguing as well. Lots of rose petals and rose water here. Some faint hints of yeast and bread as well. T: Yeah, this isn't good. Lots of floral notes but there's no hint of the base beer here at all. A bit of a buttery note with some yeast, but that's about it. Mouthfeel is waaay thin and watery.","553: Thanks to ibrew2or3 AKA McLargeHuge A: Pours a nice light bright golden yellow\u002forange hue with a small fizzy head. There is little retenion and spotty lace. S: Nice big hop aroma. There is a huge blast of grapefruit and a bit of grass. A touch of sweet malt lurks beneath. T: This one starts nice and bold. A big blast of grapefruit right from the start. Some malt cuts thru do tone things down in the middle, but the finish is nice and bitter. M: Medium body with great carbonation. D: Perfect summer brew for Florida as it comes in a can. One of the best canned IPA's out there.","558: Thanks to Kegatron for hooking me up with a can. Pours a clear amber color with 3 fingers of tall foamy off-white head. Great retention leaves lots of lacing stick. Smells of caramel, pine, grapefruit, and spicy hops. Tastes of toasted grains, caramel, citrus fruits, and bitter spicy and earthy hops in the finish. Medium in body with good carbonation. Crisp and balanced with a nice woodsy bitter finish. Easy to drink and enjoyable. A solid sessionable IPA that has me looking forward to trying more stuff from Caldera.","563: Got this one from the Nashvillian, cheers John! Pours ebony with less than a pinky of mocha colored head.Near zero head retention & lacing S: Chocolate, dark fruit, vanilla, & a touch of Bourbon once warm T: Follows the nose, plus some herbal & woody hop notes, charred grain & dryness up front. More charred grain & Baker's chocolate as this warms. Finishes with a nice chocolate sweetness, herbal hops, a bit vanilla & more charred grain MF: Chewy, oily, subtle carbonation A nice Imp Stout, didn't quite come together for perfection, but a solid offering","586: Pours out a little thin looking weak ice tea color with two fingers of slightly off-white suds and lots of lacing. Smell is strong citrus and grapefruit rind. This is a great smelling beer. Taste is piney and grapefruity with slight sugar. Mouthfeel is very clean for such a big hop brew. Not sticky at all. Very quaffable. Overall I would have to give this a 4 even though it's really in the 4.12 range. Only reason not to give it a 4.5 is the cost of this stuff. 16 dollars in Ky.","594: Thanks to flexabull for this in the UGLY BIF. Gotta love craft canned beers. Pours a pale yellow color, slight opaqueness, good sized head with a little retention layer and a little bit of lacing. Smell is stronger than I would expect from a pale ale, strong citrus and grapefruit aroma with hops, makes me think it could almost be an IPA if some more hops were added. Taste hits with the hops and citrus first, leaves an interesting bitterness in the mouth, not quite good but not quite bad, carbonation is just right and it goes down crisp and smooth, I could see this being an easily sessionable brew if it was available in Maine.","607: Poured from the brightly colored Grateful Dead concert poster-esque can into a shaker pint glass: deep orange, with a snowy white, one finger head that dissipates pretty quickly, but leaves some nice patches of lace. Aroma is dominated by citrus hops - there's also some bread crust and caramel malt in there. Taste is grapefruity, and a touch piney in the finish - some malt sweetness towards the finish, too. Mouthfeel is about medium-bodied and creamy... although it feels like something is missing -maybe a bit more body. A very drinkable IPA - can't wait to take a few to the beach soon...","608: Poured into pint glass. A - reminiscent of a pilsner more than an APA, 2 fingers of white head, head lasted a while, just kinda floated there S - light hints of citrus, mostly grapefruit and lemon, maybe a little bready T - hop blast, pretty bitter and dry, follows the smell closely M - good carbonation, good body for the style, not too light and certainly not heavy D - great for a canned beer, cant beat the portability and taste, just started to get the caldera brews in my local beer store, will continue to try new ones","616: Pours dark nice amberish color head. Smell is hoppy piney goodness Taste is hoppy (of course) I detected a tiny hint of citrus with followed by a nice grassy piney after taste. went down smooth and a wee bit creamy great beer to start the night out with. all and all typical Hopped out beer, but price VS quality one of the best out there.","618: Pours a nice clear and bright amber color with a decent head, and a bit of lacing. Aromas are pine like, earthy, pungent and resiny. Smells a bit funky, but not bad. Taste is crisp, biting, with some sharp brewed tea flavors up front. Hint of hard candy sweetness, and light creamy malt flavors. Finish is bitter, earthy, grassy, and dry. Mouthfeel is very good. Very full, smooth, and nicely carbonated. Overall, an interesting and tasty beer. A but different than most IPAs brewed on the West Coast, unique, and rough around the edges, but I like it.","620: Pours golden with 1 finger of eggshell white head. good head retention & lacing S: Slight lemony & grassy hop notes, plus a bit of breadyness T: Lemony & grapefruitty hops; plus a bit of honey malt up front. Some grainyness & grapefruit hops as this warms. Finishes crisp with a load of grapefruit MF: Light\u002f medium bodied with lively carbonation that really show cases the hops, for better or worse. Skews too hoppy, makes me think IPA more than APA Drinks pretty easy despite the OTT hoppyness.. still a solid APA","621: Appearance: Golden amber with the slightest haze and a nice sticky two finger head. Smell: Lots of signature cascade aroma - citrusy with a touch of pine. Taste & mouthfeel: Juicy citrus hop flavors supported by a dry biscuity malt backbone. Medium-light in body, crisp, dry. Moderate bitterness in the finish, though it doesn't linger too long. Very clean stuff, and incredibly drinkable. This reminds me quite a bit of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, but more raw and flavorful.","633: A: Pours a clear golden color, not too much head or lacing down the glass S: Grassy\u002fpiney type hop scent, nothing too fragrant though T: Mild sweetness followed by a nice crisp grassy\u002fherbal hop flavor M: Light to medium bodied, carbonation is pretty good O: This is a nice summer BBQ beer, I think i may like their amber better but this one is a decent pale.","634: Had this at the 27 Public House in Spokane, brought in a can and poured into a pint glass. Poured a nice copper\u002f burnt orange. nice half inch white head that laced well for most of the pint. Smelled like dried apricot and hops, hint of malt in the background in teh aftermath Tasted like it smelled, very nice balance of hops and malts, with dried fruit in there too. Drank 2 cans very easily, and a nice smooth mouthfeel. Total suprise, and a good find","647: 293rd review on Ba Can to Pint App- Light yellow with light orange highlights. A one finger head that was medium length of time sticking around. Nice lacing as well. Smell- Very basic of wheat, hops and some lemony citrus. Drink- Crisp, clean and well balanced. A nice wheat base with some crisp malts and a well done chewiness. Mouth- A medium body with a medium carb level. Nice bigger body for a small ABV beer. Drink- I feel this was a good beer. Should have checked out Caldera a long time ago. This is one of those beers that was a good way to start the evening. I would have this again during the summer for a nice beach day.","649: A-Full bronze. big light tan head. brilliantly clear. S-Some toasty malt. Light citrus hop aroma. Not a lot going on. T-Carmelly malty. Firm bitterness but more balanced to the malt than their Pale ale. Not much in the way of hop flavor. Lots of bitterness but not much flavor. M-medium bodied. medium carbonation. No alcohol burn. D-An average tasting IPA. Needs more hop flavor and aroma. Bitterness and malt are spot on. Still not a bad beer.","650: pours a copper slight haze color with a 1 finger head..smell is citrus and pine with hops and malt..taste is the same its a pine hit first with some floral hops and sweet malts.a bitter finish in the back of the mouth..this ipa is pretty tasty if you like a pney crisp ipa with some sweet malts..i could drink a couple of these no problem..but would not be my choice of ipas when looking for one","660: Can from Beerzack. Thanks! Pours Semi-clear reddish amber witha big lasting chunky whitish head that leaves lots of lacing. Smell is sweet fruity, fresh and hoppy. Very nice. Taste is smooth with fruity caramel and fresh citrusy, and sweet orange flavored hops and bitter citrus rind. Nice and strongly bittered which lasts in the finish but with a light lingering sweetness too. Very good IPA.","661: Nice amber color with a great head and lacing, plus it's in a can! Love it when beers are in cans. It smells piney and earthy and gains in the taste. Earthy Munich malts balance with a lot of citrusy and herbal northwestern hops, with some metallic and peppery notes sneaking in to make a solid but not outstanding IPA. Slight stickiness to the mouthfeel, but very drinkable overall.","673: The beer looks ok in the glass. A bit hazy with a nice thick head. It smells like butterscotch with a hint of citrus. It tastes like butterscotch with a bit of hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is ok but I can't get past the butterscotch. Am I tasting diacetyl?","683: No Canned on Date A - Pours a rich amber color. Completely clear, with minimal head. S - Sweet hoppy syrupy smells. Hints of piney resin. T - Piney, resin, floral hops. No noticeable citrus qualities. Finishes very dry and bitter. M - Medium body with moderate to high carbonation. Just right for an IPA. D - Nothing I would go out of my to get again, but nothing I'd turn down either. This is a solid IPA. Not a lot to rant about, both positive and negative. The flavors are pretty one dimensional, bitter piney hops, no citrus undertones that I enjoy so much.","690: Can recieved in a recent trade as en extra. A: Decent head, takes a minute or so to settle down. Very clear light orange colored beer. Some lacing. S: Fruity scents with not too much hops present in the nose. T: This beer just is not a solid example of the style. Really not much of a hop presence at all. With what I have heard about Caldera 'Old Growth' I was hoping this would be a pleasant surprise. I'd skip this one if I was looking for a solid IPA M: Low to medium carbonation. Slightly oily mouthfeel. O: Move along, nothing to see here.","698: Appearance: Orange-amber with a slight haze to it. The eggshell colored head retains remarkably well, leaving a ton of sticky lace behind. Smell: Floral with a bit of resiny pine and grapefruit. Great hop aroma with no noticeable malt presence. Taste & mouthfeel: Malty but very dry. Floral and resiny hop flavors follow, leading way to a bitter finish with a hint of grapefruit. The medium-light body and restrained ABV make this one seriously drinkable IPA.","713: nice burnt orange with a white head that holds fairly well and leaves very pretty lace. nose and taste consist of piney, citrusy and maybe peachyish hops with a caramelly backbone. decent mouthfeel, a little thicker would be good for me, but there is no doubt this is a first class ipa. tons of competition keep the ratings down, but i could knock these back all night and be in sweet hophead bliss the whole time.","718: A - Poured out a clear, orange color with gold highlights. It had a foamy, fizzy, one-finger layer of white foam that left minimal lacing. S - It had a moderately grassy aroma with notes of orange. It also had a gentle caramel scent. T - It tastes of bitter grassy hops with a snappy, spice flavor. The ale also had a burnt toast maltiness. M - It was sharp and lively on the tongue. A light bodied pale ale. D - This is a pleasant tasting pale ale. It's nice to have a sessionable ale in a can.","720: A - Dark gold, almost amber ale with a nice, dense, bubbly head that descends slowly and leaves nice lacing. The head revives with a swirl. S - Pine and grapefruit with a touch of wet leather. T\u002fM - Hops and leather with a touch of pine and grapefruit. Nicely supportive carbonation. The trick was to let it warm up a bit. As it warmed, it became more complex and rich. When it was cold it came across as a bit thinner so choose\u002fmake your preference. D - The alcohol is in check. If you choose to drink it cold it's ideal as a warm weather ale. Otherwise, enjoy it with seafood (e.g., mussels). Yum.","722: Nice dark orange colured ale, small lightv tan head. I dont like the aroma, it certainlly has hops aplenty, but has a sour ,sweaty work sock aroma that puts me off in the background. The flavor is better, very strong oniony hopping, pink grapefruit and spruce tips. Thin and maybe even a tad under carbonated. I dint really dig this one. I liked their Pale Ale way better.","730: A: Poured from a can to a pint glass. Had an orangey color and a cloudy texture. There was a half inch of foamy, long-lasting head and very good lacing. S: A nice aroma of citrus, hops, and a slight maltiness. T: Tasted of hops, pine, citrus, and some caramel malt. A very Western-type flavor for an IPA. M: A well-carbonated beer with a dry, crisp finish. Medium-bodied. D: A very drinkable beer that helps to dispell the myth that only bad beers come in cans.","741: I got this beer from Tilley4. Thanks Jason! 12oz can served in a standard pint glass. L - slightly hazed copper color with a bone white head that left trails of lacing. S - citrus rind and a slab of butter rolled in dirt. T - bitter citrus rind upfront with some buttery notes before getting dry and tart on the finish. F - medium bodied with a biting feel and smooth carbonation. D - goes down quick and easy.","747: A - Pours a nice amber color with a average cream head with some lacing. S - Nice Pine and Grapefruit hops but also some sweet malt on the end. T - Flavor was thinner than some IPA's but still nice with the Pine and Citrus, nice malt finish. M - Nice IPA medium body with a average carbonation. Smooth feel. D - Pretty Good. The best canned IPA I have had so far. I am sure it will be great this coming summer on a canoe trip. Like the can, easy to carry.","748: Appearance: orange-copper, good clarity, spongey layer of yellowy foam that collapses to a thin cap Aroma: luscious, billowy bouquet of caramelly malt, cooked strawberries, and woodsy hops Flavor: medium-sweet malt backbone with a biscuity\u002fcaramelly note; scrunchy, grassy hop flavor with a mellow bitterness; finishes semisweet with a fresh-hop aftertaste Mouthfeel: medium-full body, gentle carbonation, smooth Other: Small batch? Do some bigger ones of this bad boy!","751: A: a coppery, somewhat bronze type color with a nice thin layer of lace left atop. S: Malty and some dark fruit notes... plumb\u002ffig..but a sweet T: the malty sweentness blended with the dark fruits do make for an interesting tasting beer. M: medium bodied dark ale, relatively easy to drink... O: pretty good beer.","765: I didn't know what to expect from this brew when I ordered it up. I think the thing to keep in mind is this: if you are not a hop-head but love the flavor of the hop smell, this is the one for you! When I took the first sip, I realized that what this should have been called is \"hopjuice\". The taste is the supreme incarnation of Cascade hop aroma stripped off of the bitterness. I thought it was wonderful, although I knocked it down because the underlying beer characteristic did not push through as much as I would have liked. Being a NW interpretation of Red, however, the balance stood on its own very well. Terrific and recommended if you can get it.","766: Pours amber, bordering on orange. Completely white, fluffy head. Pine sap and floral bouquet for aroma. Malt sweetness is also detectable in the nose. Taste is grassy, piny, spicy. Assertive but balanced, caramel malt is present. Big merit on drinkability, a simple and flavorful IPA. Finishes clean, nice and smooth. This would be a great \"every day\" IPA, but I guess, so would Pliny.","768: Received this as an extra from adamharbaugh. Poured into a perfect pint glass. A: Very nice copper color with a big frothy head. Head retention is very good and the lacing is solid. S: Heavy grapefruit and pine notes. Very fresh and pleasant. T: The hops are very juicy and oily. M: Very full and creamy, nothing harsh of note. D: A very east to drink IPA that I could have more without a problem.","769: Pours out a clear, amber\u002forange with a 2-finger, thick, white head that leaves moderate, splotchy lacing. The smell is both fruity and malty, malt dominates. Taste is fruity, citrus hops up front then overtaken by a strong malt flavor and finishes with bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium, well-carbonated at first but low later. Drinkability is fine. I like it and many of those who like IPAs will also.","772: A: hazy pale orange. very fluffy white head. reasonable retention with better lacing. S: earthy, mellow hoppiness. bitterness dominates the aroma with a slight fruitiness. as it warms up, actually a nice sweet malt comes into play as well. T: slick, slightly metallic, hop bitterness. slightly doughy. more biscuit, dry finish. M: tingly carbonation on a medium body. D: sort of shocking that i have an APA from the west coast that isn't a hop bomb. not sure how i feel about that.","777: Poured from the can a slightly-hazed amber gold with a huge frothy off-white head. Juicy aroma of grapefruit and pine hops and sweet, bready malts. Hoppy bitterness upfront with the grapefruit and pine. Sweet malts and caramel offer a good balance. Lighter bodied, crisp and dry, with a moderate carbonation. A super sessionable and flavorful IPA from Caldera. A bit steep at $12 a sixer, but then again, I'd much rather have one of these outdoors than most other options.","778: 12 oz can poured into duvel snifter A - pours a deep amber, very lively, large white head that stays for a bit, very good looking beer S - huge citrus notes, absolutely amazing smelling beer T - amazing citrusy grapefruits and oranges amazing IPA, absolutely, the bitterness is perfectly balanced M - very smooth, creamy, easy to drink O - the best IPA I have ever had, absolutely amazing beer","779: Appearance: Pours a clear, orangey-copper body with a small, bubbly white head. Smell: Aroma of caramel malts with an herbal, citrus hop presence. Taste: Mild caramel malt flavor and sweetness. Zesty citrus hops and the taste of fresh herbs. A pinch more of those caramel malts reemerge for the overall bitter finish. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Slight stickiness to the mouthfeel. Drinkability: Whaddya know, it's a fairly good IPA.","780: Copper and light red pour, standard head to it. Dry hopping nose was there, but not huge, not super awesome or anything, just a bit of subtle vegetal hop quality to it with the peat malt thing. Citrus quality comes out on the tongue. Bitterness sustains itself throughout the entire beer. Pretty much an ordinary red spruced up with some green hops, and yes, it works. Makes the ordinary a little less ordinary. Doesn't skimp on the maltiness either. Dry finish for a red. Solid stuff, would drink again, and definitely recommend to someone who likes red ales. I am not fond of them, but enjoyed this.","783: Poured from the can into a glass tumbler. Nice aroma and pale yellow appearance. Nice fluffy head and fair amount of lacing. Taste was a big surprise, I thought any beer from a can would be a let-down. The initial malt sweetness was nicely balanced by the hop bitterness. Not like an IPA for sure but impressive anyway. Mouthfeel was O.K. and drinkability was good. Made with whole flower Cascade hops.","789: 316th review on BA can to pint No dating on can App- Dark amber orange with a gentle 1 1\u002f2 finger pancake head. Big cling in the glass. Smell- Little bit of crystal malt with some caramel sweet, maybe a pinch of graprefruity IPA'ness. Taste- A very well done IPA. Malty backbone with a spicy, fruity, candy like chew to it. Mouth- Medium bodied with a medium carb level. Fruits with a little pepper. Good stuff. Drink- I will have this again. A good IPA from a can.","805: Sampled 10\u002f30\u002f11 - Transferring the notes. A ruby pour with a half finger, off white head. Opaque. Smells like bacon it's so smoky. Very much a wood smoked scent, great on an autumn night. The flavor is full but not overbearing, smoky with a hint of sweetness. I dig this a lot, will seek out other rauchbiers for some comparison.","808: It has a dark bronze and amber body. The head and lace are full, rocky and tan. The aroma is sweet but there is some yeast spice and little floral accents. It reminds me of a pale ale flavor a bit bitter, grapefruit like but has a sweet melon finish. The mouthfeel is medium. The carbonation had a lot of staying power.","812: Pours a hazy orangish amber with 1\u002f4\" of dense, foamy, white head that has great retention. The nose has notes of bready malt, pineapple, and grapefruit with a faint flora aroma. The taste is bready and malty up front with a nice blend of hop characters ranging from pineapple, grapefruit-citrus, and faint pine. The flavors are very well blended. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, well carbonated, and very refreshing. This is delicious and very easily drinkable. I could put away a lot of these especially since the bitterness from the hops isn't overpowering like in some IPAs so no diminishing returns here.","832: Hazy apricot color with a solid frothy eggshell colored head with great retention and lacing. Visible carb at the edges. Nice floral and grapefruit hop notes on the nose. Good clean flavors. Nice mild hop notes up front with the same characteristics as the nose balanced well with the middle-backended caramel maltiness. Hops create a slightly bitter aftertaste. Mouth is crisp with a bit of a zip and high carb. Overall it's a good pale ale. A perfect beer to have in a can like it is, being a perfect beer to have while camping, golfing, fishing etc.","833: Big thanks to Bobby8405 for the share A - Pours a hazy amber-copper hue, with a rocky off-white head. S - Some citrus-y and evergreen hop aroma is available, but it is pretty tame. T - The flavor is much more potent than the aroma. There is a very classic West Coast dankness that is melded at first with the rich malt, but then separates itself and stands apart, with great herbal and leafy hop flavors lingering intensely on the finish. M - IPA. Good. D - Not the best of the West, but pretty good.","837: A - Poured out a slightly hazy, auburn\u002famber color with a thick, foamy, tan, two-finger head. It left some nice lace. S - It smelled of tons of pine. Sweet notes of grapefruit and orange peel. T - It was very peppery and spicy with a smooth burnt toast maltiness. Some subtle citrus flavors, too. M - It was crisp and sharp. A light to medium-bodied beer. D - This is a pretty good IPA. Here in the Midwest the price tag was a bit high, though.","839: My first beer from this brew...and what a goodie! Over a finger of off-white head lingers over a translucent amber. The head lives a good amount of sticky lacing all over the glass. Aromas of floral and herbal hops with a sweet but bready maltiness as a distance backbone. Earthy notes in both the aroma and taste. Tons of bitter residuals linger on the palate, thanks in part to a medium mouthfeel. This is a delicious IPA, and I look forward to grabbing more cans from this brewery!","849: Poured from a can into a standard pint glass. Beer is orange and clear. Tight white head forms and when it falls away leaves lacing on the glass. Carbonation is medium. Aroma is good but pretty simple. It is piney hop aroma and not much else, I may detect a little sweetness. It is attractive. Clean drinking beer, good bitterness all at the back finishes nearly completely. I would describe this as well balanced. As you drink it the aftertaste builds on you slightly, still a very drinkable beer. Body is medium, which is fine. I like this IPA.","854: Tastes like a hopped grapefruit, which sounds terrible but drinks pretty nice. Citrus is not overwhelming, but it's in there. I think I prefer my citrus lean toward lemon, but this is fine. Frankly, the best reason to drink this is the vessel. Drink outside by the grill on a sunny day. Go cans.","858: From a can, pours straw gold with thick white head; aroma is pine and sugar, some citrus but mostly pine. Taste is fruity, citrus, tea, slight pine, toast grain. Mouthfeel is spot on, carbonation is medium, this brew is quite refreshing! Definitely something I wanna buy in quantity to go camping with this summer!","873: I'm guessing a bit with the style on this one. I suspect it is intended as a fruit beer. The orange in the name is certainly reflected in the taste and nose as well as the colour. I found this on-tap at Kelly's Olympian and certainly hasn't been there for more than a fortnight. This brew works well. It is dry and hoppy as the name suggests, and the orange doesn't ruin this by making it too sweet. Think peel rather than juice. It is surprisingly refreshing and drinkable for such a dry beer. Not frou-frou.","876: Thanks to rayjay for the extra in a trade. Pours a slightly hazy orange with a nice, tight white head that laces like glue. Smells of massive amounts of hops, damn near all of them. Lots of citrus and pine, with some caramel malt as well. Tastes wonderfully hoppy, tons of pine and citrus yet an almost grainy note, also slightly vegetal. There is a lot of malt here to back things up, there's a nice tight carbonation and it feels dense. Very easy to drink on after an evening of flying frizbee.","877: A - Pours a clear apricot orange. 1 finger sticky-looking head. Spotted lacing S - Bready caramel malt, honey, citrus hops, tea like cracker background. Very tasty. Honey malt aftertaste T - Honey caramel, spicy hops, green bark, slightly honey kissed floral, a slight earthiness\u002fmedicinal to the aftertaste. M - Perfect. The carbonation yields a sublime texture for the style. This is a good APA. However it does have some medicinal flavors that I'm not diggin.","880: A- Nice golden copper color. A thick foamy one finger head. S- A wonderful smell of sweet grapefruit is strongly coming through. T- The sweet taste didn't come though in the taste. The taste is a bit on the maltier side. The hops taste does give some DIPA's a run for their money. The hoppyness is very much there and it is good. M- The beer is smooth and easy in the mouth. A little drying of the tongue, but not too bad. D- Easy to drink, don't have to choke it down.","883: Snagged a can of this after seeing that it's got such a positive amount of reviews. The beer poured out as a clear yellowish gold color, it has a pretty good looking soapy head on it. The lacing is a little sticky but not too much. The smell of the beer has a really nice malty and hoppy aroma. The hops smell bright and fruity. The taste of the beer was pretty good. The hops were definitely in there ready to hit ya in the mouth. The malt cleaned up the mess in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was light and refreshing. Overall it was a pretty good IPA.","887: Decidedly crimson, clear, with just under a finger of slightly off-white head with lowish retention. Good citrus-Cascade nose, but not quite as strong as I would have expected. A straightforward, dryish, slightly caramelly amber ale with a good dose of citrus hop flavor. Nothing too complicated, and entirely pleasing, though I found myself yearning for just a little more malt in the background. I love it when hop juice becomes hop syrup...","891: A - pours an amber color with a two finder head that is retained for a good 5-10 minutes. The beer is almost as clear as a lager...not cloudy at all. S - very strong citrus smells. T - similar to the smells, the first predominant taste is citrusy. After that, you get a hint of caramel. Then the hops come through and leave a nice bitterness finish. D - I love this IPA. It's one of my favorites! It's exactly how a west coast IPA should taste. The only issue could be a slight lack in carbonation.... But I find that true of most craft can beer I try.","901: Pours a nice golden peach color with a frothy long lasting ivory head. Smells of earthy grassy hops and a little citrus. Great tasting with plenty of bitterness and some grapefruit. Just enough of a malt backbone to let those grassy hops shine. A medium-bodied and flavorful IPA available in a can that reminded me of a nicer version of 60 min. If the price point were lower, I'd drink this a ton.","910: Had to get this one for the name, Grabbed a bottle when I came across it at the store. The pour was a murky orange brown color with a fluffy tan colored head on it. The smell of Belgian yeast was prominent, along with some citrusy aromas and earth too. The taste of the beer had some sweet notes up front with the fruits and brown sugars that might be in there. The finish was a little on the dry and spicy side. The mouthfeel I thought was just a little thin. Overall the beer was worth the try for sure. I would probably buy this one again in the fututre.","922: Pours a pale golden hue with a substantial fluffy head that disipates within a minute or so. smell is quite appetizing sweet spicy malts with floral hopped background. tastes of spiced bread, warming alchole flavor floral hopes, nice and bitter. Very suprised bought this thinking it was going to be mediocor which its not at all. mouthful creamy coats the mouth flavor lingers just right. Drinkablity is good, ABV 5.4%","923: This is indeed quite tasty. The jet black color is very nice not very much light getting through this beer. The head is sticky and light brown. The hops are prominent along with a ton of roasted chocolate flavors and wood in the aroma and taste. The mouthfeel is semi thick, a little oily. The beer overall is really nice.","932: A - hazey orange in color with a rocky white head which quickly dissipates to a thin film. S - the nose is rich with hops. piney and fruity. sweet caramel malt notes and some cherry esters. T - clean, lightly sweet malt upfront followed by some piney bitterness and a long cherry\u002fsweetish finish. M - smooth, creamy, a touch watery and a full zippy carbonation. O - nice IPA with lots of piney notes but could've had a bit more bitterness on the tongue.","952: Golden amber with a big foamy head that just floats on top. Crisp pale malt and floral hop aromas. Flavors of light floral hops with a good malty reflection that combine to make a honey-like finish with a light hop linger. Medium carbonation with a non descript mouthfeel. It might not look like much but it tastes great although there's also not much to talk about in the mouthfeel. I really liked the honey I tasted in the finish.","976: 12 oz. can with a slightly different look from the one shown above. No freshness date Poured a bright, clear orange with a half-inch white head. Very subdued fruity aromas which quickly fade. This is the least impressive character of this ale. The ale begins with a pleasant bitterness that lingers on the tongue. There is a very faint metallic flavor that quickly faded. Overall, this is dry and refreshing. Noticeably carbonated with a light body. The mouthfeel is clean and refreshing. While not very complex, this is a summer quaffer with its light, refreshing body and slight fruity bitterness.","981: 22oz bottle into snifter. 2011 vintage. from notes. Pours black with a thick mocha colored head that dissipates fairly quickly. The aroma is of cocoa, with roasty malts. I can just barely pick up notes of the licorice. The taste follows the nose fairly well. Cocoa mixed with astringent coffee, though the licorice is more pronounced then in the aroma. The mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied with subtle carbonation. This was quite drinkable, and left me a very good impression of the brewery.","984: Pours a very nice golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice creamy one-finger plus off-white head, lots of nice small islands and sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, big hop note, citrus\u002fpines, and caramel. The taste is very nice, malty, hoppy, with some nice citrus\u002fpine tones, with some caramel thrown in. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very solid IPA (in a can too), definitely recommended.","989: a: This was a very pale, clear golden color. It was served to me with craggy, sticky head that stuck around for awhile. s: Big piney hop nose with a little lemon. t: This tasted very fresh. Sweet flavors of toffee and then a big piny hop blast at the end. m: Fabulous carbonation, long lasting. Perfect. d: One of the best IPAs I've tried. Great stuff.","990: Produces a vast amount of foam with awesome retention, which is off white in color. The body is clear and dark copper colored. Aroma is pint and floral along with some toffee notes. The brew's taste is a bit sweet in he way of caramel upfront, and quickly dives into a piny finish. Feels oily slick from the beginning to the end, but with a mild warm finish.","991: appearance: Wow very active beer with a haze through it. The white lace does stay on top forever it felt like. Smell: Hoppy with needles. It really is a classic lager smell Taste: Clean with off flavor on the back end that I just can't put my finger on it. someone help me with it.... mouthfeel is bad. It burns there is so much carbonation. I just can't do it. It honestly sent my taste-buds into shock on the first drink there was so much activity on my tongue. I found myself wanting to rank it higher but it just wasn't there to get the higher rating.","995: 12 oz. can, A: Pours amber, nice finger sized white head, good head retention, solid lace, nice look all around. S: Oranges\u002fSimcoe, tropical fruit, pine, a very pretty smell, but understated, could be great. T: Heavy citrus dominates - orange, tangerine, grapefruit, pine in the finish. Like the Pale, the malt is very light, I like the hop profile a lot more in this one as compared to the Pale. M: Soft carbonation - perhaps from the can, medium-bodied. D: Pretty standard Northwest IPA, a fine drinking beer, not going to wow you.","1000: Reviewed on 1\u002f3\u002f2010. Can. Pours a clear deep orange with a thick off-white head. Aroma of piney, grassy hops, some citrus and tropical fruits. Flavor of caramel malt and light citrus upfront with a bitter hops finish. Decent IPA, rather on the bitter side.","1001: Pours pitch black with 1\u002f2\" of foamy, brown head. Great retention. Smells of roasted malts, a little coffee, and a little chocolate. Taste is similar to the nose in some respects but far more complex. Deep roasted malts and hint of coffee up front followed by a rich chocolatiness in the finish; just a hint of alcohol esters in there as well. A few more sips reveals a little toffee and some dark fruits; alcohol becomes more prevalent as the beer warms but doesn't detract from the flavor or drinkability. Mouthfeel is smooth, rich, and surprisingly, dangerously drinkable.","1002: Pours a clear burned orange with a creamy head that dies somewhat quickly and little to no lacing. Smells like a hop bomb with strong citrus, rind and a tiny bit of floral. Blows away your taste buds with hops and a bite of citrus. The balance isnt as great as it could be but this sure is tasty, especially if you are a hop head. Finishes wonderfully dry and bitter but doesnt linger too long on the tongue. Carbonation is perfect. A very drinkable and delicious IPA....and from a can no less.","1004: A - Poured a copper color with a big off white head that leaves a ton of lacing behind S - Is a nose full of hops that are both citrus and piney with a touch of caramel malt kicking around T - Follows the nose hops upfront more pine than citrus with the caramel malt trying to come through to add some balance M - This beer has a medium body with higher carbonation to it D - I'm enjoying this IPA quite a bit I don't know if it coming from a can is making me like it more but this beer tastes good and is worth a try if you see it around","1009: Pours a clear gold color, with a big impressive white head. Nice hoppy cascade nose. Floral, and pine like. Beer has a pretty light quality. But is still tasty. Light crisp hop flavor, a bit of malty sweetness and creaminess, and a slightly piney and resiny hop finish. Nice simple APA. Mouthfeel is pretty good. As mentioned, it's a bit light, but still feels nice in the mouth. Drinkability is very good. Light and easy drinking, yet still a tasty APA. Session worthy. I love canned craft beer!","1019: This beer poured out as a nice golden color, almost copper. The head was fluffy and white, left behind a strong lacing too. The smell of the beer was floral and citrusy. The taste of the beer has a sweet bitterness, plenty of citrusy grapefruit flavors and a touch of malt in the back end. The mouthfeel has a good bite to it, with a dry aftertaste. Overall it's a good IPA, I am glad I tried it for sure.","1028: Picked up a can at Abe's Cold Beer for a couple bucks and drank it with a Thai curry (good combo). At first seems like a simple, but tasty pale ale. The malts provide a little toast and caramel, while the hops pull in the usual citrus notes. As it warms and I think about what I'm tasting and smelling, a lot more comes out. There are hints of pineapple in the hops, hard sugar candy in the aroma, and peppery spice compliments the orange rind aftertaste. Check this beer out and make sure you let it warm up.","1031: Tapped this open and a fruity piney smell, Cloudy golden orange color when poured in a pint glass. Nice foaming thick head. Big and hoppy, yet smooth as butter. Minimal hop after taste (I like this, so was a liittle disappointed with the lack there of there) However, a delicious beer. Would drink it anytime!! I bet on draft it is a delight!","1035: Serving type- 12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass. A- Pours a pretty deep orange color with a nice lacing. S- Huge notes of citrus: grapefruit and orange. T- A good tasting IPA. Nice even bitter hoppy flavor throughout. Can't taste any alcohol which makes for an easy drinking beer. This is a good West Coast IPA but it is lacking a little when compared with other beers of the same style and region.","1051: A: gold yellow\u002flight orange bubbly\u002fshiny body, finger white fluffy head, fantastic lacing S: grapefruit, pine, lemon peel T: grapefruit, lemon, earthy malt, piny oily\u002fsticky bitter finish M: med\u002flight, light oily\u002fsticky mouth O: Yummy, easy going APA. Great session brew, highly recommend, will buy again. Thrilled to see another extremely tasty, lighter American craft brew. Going to become a regular in my frig! VERY GOOD, TREAT YOURSELF!","1064: Poured into tulip glass. Appearance: Deep mahogany with red hue, pours 1 finger of off-white head that fades quickly. Lots of lacing. Smell: Roasted malt, chocolate, orange zest, slightly boozy as it warms, raw sugars. Taste: roasted malt, chocolate, blood orange, sweet, brown sugar. Mouthfeel: full bodied, good carbonation. Overall: A tasty porter. I like the subtle blood orange element. Not a lot going on here, but what there is is quite good. Drinkability is above average.","1065: Split the bomber with my girlfriend who picked it out because of the roses. Pours a clear gold\u002forange with a small white head. Smells floral as expected with some malty sweetness too. Not really picking up heavy roses on the nose. Tastes weirdly floral, but not good floral like a heavily cascade hopped beer. Hardly any hops at all, just a weird rose flavor. Good news is if I ever want this flavor again, I have a large rose bush in my front yard. Undercarbonation leads to an even worse experience. My first drain pour in quite a while. After a few sips these became way too overpowering and going through 22 oz wasn't happening.","1072: Can from K&L Redwood City. A - Pours a bright medium amber color with a two-finger, lasting off-white head and good lacing. S - Aroma is piney and citrusy hops, a touch of sweet malt, and tropical fruits. T - Flavor is a little pale and caramel malt, but mostly showcases a complex hop profile, with pine, pineapple, orange, and grapefruit. Pretty harshly bitter, although I like that of course. M - Crisp palate with medium body and carbonation. D - Solid. Overall this is the best canned IPA I've had after Surly Furious.","1073: Thanks to 5000 for sending this can my way. The beer pours a dark amber color with a white head. Darker than expected. The aroma is very nice. I get a lot of grapefruit and pine notes. The flavor is similar. The predominant flavor is some resiny pine from the hops but I also get some grapefruit. The toffee and caramel malt backbone balance out the beer nicely and keep the bitterness level fairly low for a west coast IPA. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very nice.","1082: Found this on vacation at the piggly wiggly in Myrtle Beach, SC. What a pleasnt treat \u002fsuprise!Tasted great even right out of the can.Appeared to have a deep golden color kind of darkish. Smelled nice and hoppy and fruity small bit of floral.Taste was straight up IPA wich is a great thing in my book.Mouth was smooth and pleasant with a nice amount of hops bitterness.These babies have a drinkability that is very nice,went down real nice in the heat and the cans were a big plus for transportation.Wish this brew was around my area!!!!","1094: received as an extra from I wish I remember who... poured from a can a hazy gold to a dogfish head signature glass with a very thin and short lasting head that interestingly left a fair amount of lacing. smell of strong citrus upon popping the can that transitioned to mild hops afterward. sweet forward fading to a bitter bite at the back of the tongue. I don't think it was cold enough for my taste with this style of beer - next time around it's going in th freezer for 15 minutes before opening.","1096: Clear golden-orange color with small white head that laces well. Slightly sweet and spicy toasty grain with some floral and slightly woodsy and fruity hops. Lightly toasted and sweet fruity pale malts perfectly balanced by orangey citrus and floral hop bitterness that's a bit persistent. Nice light-moderate body that feels even easier due to the high, but no too stingy carbonation. Extremely drinkable Pale that I would definitely buy again.","1111: Bomber pours a clear straw yellow body with a small vanilla head that quickly drops into some scattered lacing. Aroma has some crackery malt and a hint of floral hops. Mouthfeel is light bodied with a spritzy carbonation. Taste is dominated by a crackery pilsner type maltiness that is balanced by a dry grassy and floral hoppiness. Reminds me of kolsch. Unpretentious and unoffensive. A decent lawn mower beer, I suppose.","1121: A- Aggressive pour yields a three inch off white head. Beer itself is a somewhat cloudy dull light orange. Awesome head retention with above average lacing. S- Bright citrus notes...think lemons, oranges. T- Follows the nose. With a noticeable, but not overpowering, dose of hops on the back end. Well balanced. Alcoholic orange juice, mmmph. M- Medium mouthfeel. Carbonation is lacking a bit it seems. D\u002fO- One of the better pale ales I've had in awhile. Drinkability is the tits...and in cans no less! First Caldera offering is a winner in my book.","1126: Poured from a can into a pint glass A - Amber in color with a thick, off-white head. S - Not as much hop aroma as I had hoped. There is some citrusy hop aroma and a bit of stickiness to it. T - better hop character in the taste. Good malt backbone to balance the hops. The finish is a bit chalky and biscuity. M - The biscuitiness interferes with the mouthfeel to me. A bit too thick on the tongue for an IPA. D - Nothing unpleasant about the way this one goes down. Alcohol is well masked and the carbonation level is right where it needs to be.","1134: Pours a mahogany color, rich, with a tan head. a finger, didn't stick around. Holy smokes! This is one of the most smokiest beer I've ever had! BUT. It's balance and not one sided. Smoke, cured bacon, rich caramel malts. More smoke. Ok, maybe it one sided, but it's heavenly. Rich caramel malts and salty cured bacon strips. Bacon lover right here, so, I don't feel the need to go on. Lighter, but medium in body. feels fine. Nothing tremendous. Aroma and flavor alone are mouthwatering. Bravo. More please!!!","1136: A- Pours a nice amber color with a whit head. S- Hops with a citrus tone hint of malt. T- Hops and citrus tones with a hint of a malt finish. M- Semi dry with hop flavors through out sip and a malt finish. D- Pretty good beer from Oregon. I can drink this again with no worries. Cheers...","1137: Appearance: Pale golden pumpkin color with a 2 finger beige creamy head that looks like rocky whipped cream only not as bright white. Good head retention and lacing. Smell: Lots and lots of grapefruit from the hops. Extremely well done. Not overbearing but undeniably grapefruit rind goodness. Taste: Closer to a pale ale with a lot of grapefruit character. Not sure if its chinook hops or cascade that are being used here. Mouthfeel: A bit thin for my liking. Drinkability: Fairly easy to throw these 6.1 ABV cans back.","1143: Pours a bronze\u002famber color with a thick, creamy, fluffy white head. Dies down and leaves a lot of lacing along the side of the glass. Smell is highly, bitterly hopped. I think I can smell mt. hood hops, pine, black pepper, grass\u002fweedy smell, earthy. Taste is completely bittering with a smooth body. Black pepper in the taste, as well as that earthiness to it. Light carbonation brings out the slight malty flavors. Mostly though its pretty hoppy.","1145: Was pretty excited to see some limited 22's from Caldera down this way. Interesting art work on the bottle. A-ruby, brown almost a dark mahogany, small half finger head and translucent S-Orange, cherry and chocolate-Terry Chocolate Orange upfront, a faint grassy smell in the end T- light malts and belgian yeast. light orange and cherries with a slight bitterness on the end M-watery, light carbonation, not much body to it D-Overall, the taste was interesting but light, I wish it tasted as good as the smell was. There was not much body to this one for being a strong dark Belgian.","1150: A: Pours a cloudy orange with a crisp white two finger head layer. S: Slightly citrusy with a bit of hops here, too. T: Malty and hoppy, but neither overpowers. Very well balanced. M: Calm and balanced flavors. D: This would be a great beer for a hot summer day. Nothing wild, but simply a good beer.","1152: A= basic blonde, mild white head, decent lacing. S= honey and floral hops notes. More evident as the beer warmed for a few minutes. T= immediately astringent and dry, somewhat watery, some florals, pine, bitters. M= astringent, some bitterness, florals. D= fine if you like it, depends on the price versus better APA offerings.","1155: A: In a pint glass. Clear amber, nice yellowish head. S: Piney, citrusy hops. Malty, bready, herbal. T: Like smell. Bitter. I like this. MF: Like most beers for me, not remarkable; standard for the style. D: Very drinkable. It's a little pricey and only sold by the can. But if it were cheaper\u002fsold in 6 packs here I'd definitely pick up a sixer.","1162: Poured into a tulip glass. A light golden orange color. Very clear with almost 2 fingers of creamy rich pillowy head. This thing smells like candied hops. Lots of orange citrus covered in caramel. Tastes alot like the aroma only a bit on the lighter side. The citrus is there, the caramel is there and there is also a small amount of floral notes as well. Light to medium bodied with a crisp bitter finish. Overall this is an excellent canned IPA that i could drink all day long. Notes: Review taken from notes written on 5-25-10","1168: A: Poured a pale amber color, clear with good carbonation leaving a nice white head S: Light caramel, hops, bitterness, some citrus and floral notes T: Floral and citrus with impressive hops, def a American West Coast IPA here. M: Lighter bodied with hop bitterness leaving a crisp, bitterness D: Good. I actually thought this could have been a modest single IPA as well","1179: Pours a clear very light yellow with strong carbonation but a weak head. The aroma is sweet, non-descript malt with just a touch of grassy hops and some graininess. The flavor is quite similar with pale malt sweetness, some grassy herbal hops, clean yeast, grainy notes and a surprising amount of bitterness. I have to say that the flavor is pretty disappointing, even for this style, though the dryness does give it some merit. Mouthfeel is not just light, but watery. It has a nice dry finish and is very quaffable, and holds up alright when compared to other beers in this category, but I think there are better options.","1183: A: Deep apricot hue with a huge, beautiful, sudsy cream-colored head; lacing is great S: Lots of wonderful citrus from the hops: peach, mango, pineapple, lemon, grapefruit, and tea leaves with a slightly grassy and grainy malt undertone T: Hops are a touch more muted than aromas indicated but still plenty of citrus, tea leaves, pine, and weed F: Quite creamy upfront and finishing pretty well--though a touch thin O: A nice hop-forward IPA in a can, which you can never get enough of; something I'd like to try even fresher and something I will definitely come back to","1199: A: An amazingly clear, golden pour from can into glass with a fluffy white head that sits on top. S: Just as a pale ale should be: a refreshing citrus aroma with a mild pine to let you know that it still means business. T: Again, a perfect example of a pale ale. A nice clean, refreshing citrus flavor followed by a nice bitter bite on the finish. M: The beer is light and moderately carbonated, but still has a fairly substantial feel on the tongue. D: This must be what Bud is talking about. These guys sure know how to make a great session pale and IPA. I'm glad to see these beers become more easy to come by in CA.","1215: Poured from a 12 oz can into a pint glass. Pours a hazy copper color, with a very small head. Not much lacing. The aroma is very hop forward, notes of citrus. Everything good about the nose gets ramped up a notch in the taste. Huge grapefruit and orange flavors, good malt backbone and a really nice hop finish. Medium bodied, carbonation is good. An incredibly drinkable IPA, will definately seek out again!","1231: Pours golden with a medium sized white foam. Retention is okay, but lacing sticks well. Aroma is bready, somewhat malty, and hoppy. Piney and citrusy. Bready, biscuity, malty with a hop character in the finish. The breadyness makes this almost \"buttery\" in texture. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium and creamy. Carbonation is okay. Drinkability is rather high...lower ABV, great mouthfeel, good taste.","1237: My thirst is getting to me, so why not an IPA to quench it? On to the beer: It's all good in looks; dense head, iron orange color in my glass, good retention. The nose is the expected NW IPA dose of lychee, grapefruit, and pine sap. As suggested the nose, this IPA goes towards the \"dirty hop\" side. Big smack of grapefruit, pine, lingering hop bitterness on the palate, and a hint of orange. The aftertaste of sap lingers softly. The beer has a smooth body with carbonation that doesn't seem like it's there. In all respects, a respectable IPA.","1240: A: Pours to a frothey tan head with a deep and beautiful copper body. Excellent lacing. S: Slight, hoppy, piney aroma. T: Citrusy with piney hops. Crisp and not real bitter but it does have a slight bite with lasting flavor. The hops definitely comes through. A nice IPA that doesn't knock you over. Typically what an IPA is suppose to be. M: Lightly carbonated, smooth and thin. Not watery or oily. D: Refreshing and while not a session beer, you can easily enjoy a couple of these without any problems. One of the better canned micro-brews that I have tried.","1255: A - pours a clear orangish rust color with a half inch of sticky white foam S - nice citrus hop aroma of lemon and grapefruit and bready malts T - bready malt backbone with some nice citrus hops and a good hoppy bite in the finish M\u002fD - light bodied with lots of flavor, crisp mouthfeel, i'm definitely going to have more of this one","1256: As far as the look goes on this one, it looks kinda copper as I stare down into the can. Its a caldera baby, celebrate the can and drink from it. This is a nice smelling ipa, moderate amount of pine, and citrus. Smells like cascade hops. As far as taste its not scrape your tongue hoppy, but it is definitely flavorful. Has the bitterness in the corners of your mouth feeling. Its piney and floral. Mouthfeel is bubbly and a bit dry. Overall a very well rounded session ipa.","1257: Copper colored beer with a nice sticky off-white head with some orange hues. Classic Western IPA aroma of loads of citric hops. Also some mildly herbal aromas but this beer is all about the C-hops. Well balanced yet still hoppy. Grapefruit, pinecones and fresh mint in the flavor. Medium to full bodied and wayyy too drinkable. I looked down and my glass was empty. A great IPA in a can, what's not to love. Oh yeah, we can't get it in NC that's what's not to love.","1260: A - Pours a medium amber color with a 1-2 finger head with some lacing. S - You get hit with the regular Pine and Citrus but also some sweet malt on the back end T - Flavor was thinner than some IPA's but still nice with the Pine and Citrus, almost a little too much malt on the back end for me and not as smooth as I would have hoped. M - Crisp IPA light\u002fmedium body with medium carbonation. D - Pretty Good. The best canned IPA I have had, although it was my first canned IPA. Next time I think I would rather have two Pliny's to a six pack of this.","1261: A: Poured a copperish orange color with good carbonation and a nice white head S: Caramel, bread, pine and light booze T: Taste follows nose pretty well. Balanced, with a good caramel and breadiness, floral and pine notes M: Nice lingering bitterness and sweet, sticky feel D: Good","1265: A: Yellow and clear. Nice 1 finger white head. S: Not much here. Slight Cascade hops and malt. I was a bit disappointed at first because the smell was unimpressive. T: A nice mix of the C hops. This gives a mouth full of bitter grapefruit and citrus. M: Very bitter, just like it should be. It is also quite crisp, which makes for a refreshing IPA. No alcohol burn at all. D: This is an excellent easy drinking IPA. I wish the aroma was a little more hoppy, but overall I enjoyed the brew. I am happy to find this on the shelves at my local craft beer store.","1268: Canned: unk A: pours honey with near excellent clarity and a finger of off-white foam which falls rather quickly to a solid sheet of the same with strong spotty lacing. S: Some herbal hops, some citric hops, honey, sweet malts, smells a little faded. Nothing special. T: Strong bitterness with some vitamin flavors, a hint of lemon, some sweet malts with a hint of oxidation. M: Medium bodied with moderate carb and dry finish. O: Not a bad beer, tastes a little faded, but is quaffible.","1275: Pours a slightly hazy copper orange with a huge creamy white head. Huge floral and citrus nose with some bready malt notes. Flavor is dominated by Perfume\u002ffloral\u002fcitrus hop flavor, and a great bitterness to caramel\u002ftoasty malt profile. Moderate carbonation and creamy mouthfeel. This was delicious, thanks adamharbaugh for the opportunity.","1276: Poured from a 12oz can into a nonic. Thanks to BA redbird. This brew pours a cloudy golden-amber color crested with two fingers of head that retains well and leaves great lacing. The smell is great. Hops, grapefruit, and some caramel malts. A normal IPA nose, but done well. The taste is that of a well-done, well-balanced IPA. The malts and hops are quite harmonious, neither taking over too far. There's some ever present grapefruit here as well. The aftertaste does bring in a great deal of hop resin over malts. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both solid. Just a well-done IPA.","1284: Clear orange-copper, or weak iced-tea in color with fine foamy covering that leaves some nice lace. Nice perfumy cascade-like aroma. Some citrus, pine and floral hops. Assertively hoppy. Lots of woodsy pine and some citrus peel. Kinda astringent bitter finish. Slightly stingy aggressive carbonation does not help the already astringent character of the beer. Pretty drinkable, despite the astringent impression.","1290: Great looking 12oz can poured into pint glass. Pours a golden amber color with tons of frothy head and gobs of lacing on the sides of the glass. Very piney hoppy smell. Taste is a slap in the tongue with pine followed by orange citrus. Amazing hop profile on par with super hopped double\u002fimperial IPA's. Light dry mouthfeel that really dries out your mouth. Great drinkability hindered only by the hop blast that will quickly leave your taste buds dulled. Overall this is an amazing IPA that blows my mind every time I drink it.","1299: Amber with hints of orange with big tan foamy head with good retention and uneven lacing. Big citrus hop aroma. Big bitter grapefruit up frony with good caramel mellowing backbone. Smooth, silky feel with a low carb feel despite the big foamy head. A good overhopped IPA that's pleasant yet slightly one dimensional. Not worth $13.50\u002f6 pack unless you really need a good IPA in a can.","1303: Appearance: Pours a hazy, yellow-orange body with a thin, wispy white head. Smell: Aroma of herbal, citrus hops accompanied by a honey-laden maltiness. Taste: Mild pale malts with a bit of toastiness and a soft honey-like sweetness. Citrus and bitter herbs. Medium bitterness. Finishes dry. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Drinkability: A fair pale ale, but I gotta say I enjoyed the Caldera IPA far, far more.","1304: Poured amber from the can. Nice one inch head with plenty of lacing. Aroma is earthy citrus hops and a bit of sweet malt. Flavor is usual hops citrus and pine in this case. Nice balance of hops and malts with hops dominating. Good mouthfeel not too watery. Amazingly good canned beer! Highly recommended if you enjoy IPA's. Try the APA also.","1314: Red mahagonny. Yellow tinted head, thick full and dense, holds itself with stern authority. Sticky lacing also. Great hop aroma. Thick citrus fruit with berry components. A bready sweet malt really mends well with the abundance of fruit. Impeccably balanced. Nothing out of the ordinary necessarily but one of those brews that is just dead on. Bitter finish with fruit driven mid palate and a toffee core, all intertwined with dried berry puree. Nice and thick and drinkable.","1320: I had this on tap last in August of 2009 at Bailey's Taproom in Portland, Oregon. The colour was a very dark brown with a garnet base and a thin tan head. The aroma was full of coffee, roasted malt and chocolate. On the palate, there was light CO2, day old coffee, some dark chocolate and more roasted malt.","1321: Tap handle red \"Dry Hop Orange\" but alas, here we go. Warm hoppy sack of Mt. Hood on the nose. Citrus and Oranges rise up to the nearly caustic bitterness. Thinish mouthfeel, but damned drinkable. Amazing blend of malt and hop gives this a shockingly Orange Juice like flavor. I was convinced this was a fruit\u002fvegetable beer, and my notes end with \"blows ApriHop out of the water\". Hey, it was a long night of beer tasting ... still this was one tasty brew to quaff through the hot Portland summer night.","1325: Clear light copper. Thick offwhite head. Decent retention. Nice tight laces. Pine, floral, citrus, and spicy hop aromas. Rich toasty, mild sweet caramel and a touch of vanilla. Crisp grapefruit, floral, pine, spicy resins. Toasty sweet caramel rolls in. Piney\u002fpeppery bitterness. Smooth, semi-rich medium body. good medium carbonation. Some drying and stickiness. Great canned IPA. Very drinkable and very tasty. Tailgating and camping and grilling favorite.","1327: Pours a clean orange-ish to copper color with a light tan head. In the aroma, faint pine like hops. In the taste, mellow pine hops and a nice malt balance. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry to clean hop aftertaste. More a pale than IPA, but decent nonetheless.","1331: 12oz can poured into a pint Pours a hazy golden color with a fluffy white head. Some nice staying power and spider web lacing. The aroma is musty and earthy with layers of pine and orange. On the palate, this guy is a little more pine and citrus forward while the earthy, musty hops come through in the middle. The finish is earthy bitter with a touch of pine resin. Light medium body with good carbonation. This is a nice pale ale that deserves a spot in any rotation. Borderline sessionable.","1334: Wierd tasting IPA, thrown in a trade. Starts OK, and then residual odd hop flavours. Medium yellow body, a quarter inch of white foam. A little hop aromas. Not skunky, but just another AMerican IPA to me, with moe astringency than balance. A bit aggressive carbonation.","1347: 12oz can. A) Pours with a tight, creamy head. Takes a bit to settle. Hazy body, amber in color. Sticky lacing. S) Piney. Grapefruit. Caramel. T) Well balanced flavor combination. Caramel. Orange. Starts a little bit bitter then moves right into the malty sweetness. Finishes with a hop bit and subtle spruce and alcohol. M) Crisp up front then smooths out. Medium body. D) A well crafted brew. I'd definitely drink another one.","1353: Nice amber color and sticky white head. Light hop presence backed by a strong malt body and a bit of yeast. A bit flowery and sweet. Tastes solidly malty with a decent hop touch. A bit sour on the finish but otherwise not bad at all. Finishes smooth as well. Not bad, a more enjoyable amber and very nice looking to say the least.","1375: 12oz can into nonic. Crystal clear honey amber hue with a thick two finger head that seems to last forever. The malts are well hidden behind very aromatic piney hops. A little bit of honey is in the background. Though the hops are sharp, the seem slightly subdued. Toasty grains set the base, which linger throughout. The hops provide a citrusy and bitter flavor, with a little bit of lingering sweet fruit. Full bodied. This one seemed to disappear from my glass quickly. Very drinkable and well rounded. I like this one a little better than their Pale Ale, although both are good. Recommended.","1386: Vintage 2010. A: Quarter finger light mocha fades to translucent of the same. Beer is dark, dark brown. No lacing to speak of. S: Extra roasty. Coffee, graham, cocoa, malt, licorice. I can say, however, the hops are still quite present. Piney, resiny. Malt dominant, but still hoppy. T: Roast, cocoa, coffee, lighter hops with earthy feel. Good beer. Not spending much time here, but this is really good. M: thick and syrupy. Like a good beer should be in this genre. D: this is a really good beer. I hate to be a slave to price point, but at nearly $13 for a bomber, I want to be wowed. The beer is good, really really good. If under $9\u002fbomber, I would be all about this one.","1390: on tap at Uber Tavern, poured in a standard pint. A - Amber-gold with nice off-white head that leaves pretty decent lace sticking all over the glass. S - snappy pine and citrus rind. T - Pine resinous and bitter herbal hops with nice grainy backbone. M - nice coating medium body with risp carbonation and fry finish. D - Fairly layered for a somewhat straight forward flavor profile, revealing itself over time which makes it more drinkable than it seems at first.","1398: Poured from 12 oz can into pint mug: A - Dark golden amber in color. Clear, with nice 2 finger, off-white head. Excellent lacing on glass. S - Citrus,pine, grassy, malty. T - Golden malt at first; quickly followed by citrus and pine. Finishes fairly dry but leaves slight metallic aftertaste. M - Medium. Carbonation is very fine in character. D - As big as this is on flavor, I would have thought the ABV would be more than 6.1%. It's very drinkable; but at @ $14.006 pack it will have to be an occasional treat.","1403: Poured from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass, the beer has a deep red-copper color with a small, thin 1\u002f2\" head that dissipates quickly. The beer is heavily smelling of hops and floral, with a little bit of a smokey background. The hops flavor hits the middle of the tongue, and there is a very short lasting, bitter undertone to it. There is a bitter and at the same time sour aftertaste to the finish, and the bitter portion of that will linger from some time after the beer is gone. It's a heavy IPA that is full of flavor in mouth, but the lingering aftertaste makes this a \"one and done\" for me. I thoroughly enjoy this beer, but one bomber at a time.","1404: Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Appearance: Pours a clear very dark redish amber with a finger of tan head that fades to a ring. Smell: Malty with some fruity notes along with mild chocolate and spice. Taste: More fruit here than in the smell. Malty and quite sweet, I'm picking up just a bit of the orange. The finish is malty and bitter. Mouthfeel: Medium body with prickly carbonation and a dry finish. Overall: Not as much citrus and I would have expected. I would have liked more fruit to go along with everything else. I would probably pass on this one in the future.","1411: A- Nice bright red color with a pretty foamy head. Lace is allready showing off and trying to get me to take a sip before finishing the sentance. S- Heavy citrus blend with a sweet finish. Smells like a much hoppier beer than an IPA. T- Much maltier than the nose lets on, sweeter too. I taste a lot of grain and oils. Slightly buttery. M- Truely a medium bodied sample. Not watery but definatley not full either. D- Good pick up from the store as something new. Not something I would recommend to a friend as a must try, but a maybe try for those looking to try new IPAs. Thanks Caldera...another decent brew from Oregon.","1412: A: A light orange gold, with modest tightly knit bit of head that stays. S: Nice piney, grapefruit and citrus, hint of biscuity malts T: First flavors are a strong, piney, grapefruit bite, with a tad of crystalish malts barely balancing it out, then a bitter finish of resinous west coast hops. M: Medium bodied, average carbonation, slightly sticky, cloying finish. maybe from the hops. D: Decent drinkability, though I've had much more drinkable IPA's. Still a very delicious west coast IPA well worth the try. Just probably wouldn't make this session beer.","1433: Picked up a 6-pack at State Line in Maryland. Poured a golden amber with a good white head. This beer reminds me of Dale's Pale Ale, and not because of the can. There's a big punch of citrus and pine hops that's met (more so here than with Dale's) by a hit of caramel malt. Very drinkable and a tasty, more balanced IPA.","1445: Pours very nice dark golden yellow color, nice carbonation, awesome two finger creamy white head, lots and lots of nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, very nice touch of hops, slight citrus, and caramel. The taste is a nice blend of hops\u002fmalts, somce citrus\u002fcaramel. The finish is dry and bitter. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a very nice Pale Ale, recommended.","1449: A - Pours a hazy burnt orange. A billowy 3 finger head. Average lacing. S - Big citrus aroma, caramel, hints of alcohol, dried herbs. T - Citrus hops with some strawberry fruitiness. Some floral spice in the back fades into toasted caramel malt. The malt has a nice sweetness that keeps the hops from taking over everything. The malt seems shy at first but opens up as you go. My first IPA out of a can. Very easy drinking. Good stuff!","1454: Some discrepancy since the tap pull said Dry Hop Orange, but since nothing else shows on the site, I assume its the same thing.... Wonderfully rich copper color with drops of a rich red turning it darker. Nice foam cap clinging tightly with a pleasant yet assertive fresh citrus hop aroma. The taste is of similar richness. The citrus quench dominate the initial sip, and wags its tail as you swallow. A nice crisp malt body in the middle with enough richness to make it a red. Really, a very pleasing beer, perfect for the lupomaniac in your life.","1479: A - pours a deep rust orange with 1\u002f4 inch of white foam S - citrus and hints of piney hops T - slightly citrus hops with a major piney hop kick at the end, not overpoweringly bitter, just a really tasty treat M\u002fD - medium bodied and decent carbonation, definitely a nice IPA that I could have several of","1487: A: Poured a nice golden color with good carbonation and a white head S: Floral notes, herbal, light booze T: Caramel, floral, even some biscuity notes at times M: Nice feel, crisp and a good drink D: Very good. Nice taste, very good West Coast take on a APA.","1490: Drank 11\u002f5\u002f11 A: A slightly reddish amber hue, with a head that dissipates quickly and completely. Intriguing simply because it's a different color. S: It smells like an orange chocolate bar. Not what I was expecting at all, but I like it. Not the most exceptional or complex beer I've had, but it's good. T: Again, orange chocolate. Mmm mmm good. Very well balanced, and not a hint of booze. M: Good intermediate body, but nothing special. O: I enjoyed this beer, but I much prefer Caldera's other offerings.","1493: 12oz can poured into a pint glass Pours a bright yellow with nice head, very little lacing. Smells slightly hoppy, mostly wet greens. Taste is a tiny little bit of honey and a fair amount of hops, some floral. Nice bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light and effervescent. Pretty drinkable. Not as good as their IPA, I don't think.","1514: A: Pale amber in color, beutifully clear, with a nice white head. S: Sweet caramel, a slight tropical fruit flavor with a hint of pine wood. T: Sweet fruit flavor at first, followed by a nice tropical hops flavor. A bit of a malt in the back, but the hop flavor dominate. Not too bitter, just pleasantly hoppy. M: Medium bodied, slightly chewy, perhaps a little over carb'd D: Very good overall, but I would like to see a little more balance from the malty side. I think the hop profile is dead on.","1521: Reddish copper with pumpkin highlights and a dense cream and orange head of foam that leaves sticky lace on the glass. Citrusy and minty C-hops with plenty of caramely malt. It must be the can, the hop fresh flavors are off the charts with plenty of juicy grapefruit and orange backed with enough caramel malt to balance but still be hop forward. Medium bodied with prickly carbonation. A really nice session IPA.","1527: A golden orange and slightly fizzy brew with a slight fluffy off-white head that constricts slowly instead of outright fading away. A few minuscule dots of lace line the glass. A note of citrus hops is noticed on the nose at first, then a slight caramel sweetness follows up. Melon rind, a squirt of lemon on the tongue, some graininess in the background, and a drop of honey makes for a happy palate. Light to medium bodied with crisp edges. Cohesion is bliss.","1532: Pours crystal clear golden amber, yellowish thick head, chunky head that falls leaving ample lacing. Smells like cidery malt, hops seemed to be subdued, slight fruitiness. Taste is bitter up front, astringent bitterness twang, slight malt but the body is too light to carry the bitterness. Borderline metallic taste, slightest fruitiness. Not the most fantastic but something I can finish, I'd probably buy this again, as the brew isn't too heavy like some IPAs.","1538: A- Good copper amber with a head that lingers. S - Pine, tropical fruit, and caramely malt T - A balanced IPA. The hops give it a good fruity and bitter punch, but the caramel malts really give the most character and are present and linger throughout the whole experience. M - Decent carbonation, not too carbonated, and smooth mouthfeel. O - A highly sessionable and pleasant IPA!","1546: Deep dark orange in color with a one-finger tan head which lingers a second then drops away leaving a few small specks of lace. Sweet malts and oily hops rise pleasantly to the nose. Some subtle pine is mixed in. Tastes of bright fresh citrusy hops and the malt backbone does it's job evening things out well. Not as big on the hops as many other IPA's, but being that it comes in the can this one begs to be taken to the lake or to the beach as it has just enough taste to keep things interesting, and the fact that it's in a can is fookin' cool.","1548: Poured from the can into a Sam Adams \"Perfect\" pint glass. (I don't know why, but beer seems to taste better out of this glass vs a regular pint glass. Call me crazy) A - Nice dark burnt orange color, off-white head, good lacing. S - Pine, grapefruit, mango, nice!!! T - Bitter and piney upfront, with a nice grapefuit and earthy end. Well balanced. Tasty. M - Medium with medium amount of carbonation. D - High. Very tasting and refreshing. Not the hoppiest IPA out there, but well-balanced and tasty. Extremely easy to drink. Great beer. I am really starting to like these Caldera guys!","1564: Dark red color, light beige foam, average. In the smell malt and caramel, not really light. Again malt and caramel in the taste, not bad in the end. Maybe a note of honey in teh back, and a light fruitiness. Average body. In the aftertaste a light bitterness, with the malt and red fruit. Nothing exceptional, but not bad, drinkable beer.","1565: Appearance - This is a dark malty brownish-bronze in color with a good, off-white head that pitted well. Smell - The pine and citrus here is very tight and wrapped in a malty toasted base. The hops are very raw and fresh. Taste - The malt gets bigger at the taste but the hops are still, well, hopping. The malt adds some sweetness here, maybe caramel, and the pine actually seems bigger as well which is the exact opposite of most every other AIPA. Mouthfeel - This is medium-bodied with some bitterness but nothing heavy. The carbs are very light but well done. Drinkability - This is a quality but uneventful drink. You won't impress anyone by serving this but you won't disappoint.","1583: Golden with a dense white head and a massive cascading of carbonation rising to the surface. Clean, sweet, graininess with a nice dose of floral\u002fcitric\u002f herbal hops. Cascades are definitely at work in this brew. Finish is dry and crisp with a perfect amount of bitterness. A more than solid Pale Ale from the folks at Caldera. This one is all West Coast.","1585: I got this one as an extra from one of those awesome West Coast BAs! Thanks! This one pours a nice golden color with an off-whie head. Nice lacing that lasts. Upon popping the top I was hit immediately by a cascate of hoppy smells coming from the can. Smells delicious with the malt to balance things nicely. The taste follows the nose with a nice, crisp finish. In the mouth this one is nice and creamy. This is a highly drinkable beer. It has a nice hoppy dry finish that keeps your mouth wanting more.","1589: Pours a deep gold with a 2 finger head that dissipates to a fine layer, leaving lots of sticky lacing on the glass. Floral hoppy aromas, salty biscuits, and a whiff of ginger. Malty biscuit flavor, then a strong taste of bitter greens\u002fgreen pepper, with a lingering grapefruit finish. Hops are a bit numbing on the tongue. Body is light and the carbonation is enough to give this a moderately creamy mouthfeel. Eminently drinkable beer, for those who like their IPAs with a bitter green hop taste.","1593: The beer pours a nice yellow-orange, with a thick white head. Looks delish. Maybe its my nose, but I don't detect too much - citrusy hops with a pine undergirding. But the taste is exceptional. Wonderfully bright hops and a satisfying malt backbone. But like most west coast ipas, this is not balanced...thankfully. A hops explosion of grapefruit, spice, and pine. Awesome. This is the best IPA i've had in a can...and one of the better ones around PERIOD. Check this one out.","1616: Ordered this from Liquid Solutions with my Abyss order. Pours a dark yellow, with a good deal of white foam which sticks to the glass. Smells like a strong IPA, citrusy. Taste is where the problem was. Hardly any citrus taste at all, no malt either, just a one-dimensional sour bitterness that was very unpleasant. Not happening and not drinkable at all. I couldn't finish this one.","1623: A: Beer poured a light amber color with a orange hue and large 1\" off white head that lasted for sometime. Good lacing on the sides of the glass throughout consumption. S: Citrus, orange pith, pine, and some light caramel notes. T: As with the smell I get grapefruit, orange pith, lots of pine and some light caramel malt balance. This one is pretty hop dominate. M: Medium-light bodied, good carbonation with a drying finish. D: This beer is definately six pack worth and will be one of my camping beers from here on out.","1626: Pours a crisp clear pale gold color with a small head that dissipates rather quickly. Has a bitter hoppy pine and citrus smell. Very pungent for a APA. Bitter bite hits right away and fades to a smooth caramel malty biscuity flavor. Not very complex, but good tastes none the less. A very light smooth beer. Very sessionable could def hammer a few of these back.","1627: HOPS! If you like a hoppy beer, this is for you. Pours a golden brown with a nice foamy head. Complex flavors keep you interested with citrus and fruity notes. Just enough maltiness to keep the hops from being completely overwhelming. Aroma is strong with fruity citrus notes as well.","1649: A: Poured a hazy amber color with a nice white cap S: Faded piney hops, caramel T: Caramel and faded hops battle for dominance while the metallic and old Earthy notes fight for second place. Bad. M: Medium to full body and not one I would recommend hiolding on your palate O: Poor IPA, drainpoured after two sips","1658: First micro brew for me in a can. Cool logo but with no freshness date. It pours a amber color with a nice sea foam head. The smell is strong of hops. The taste hits you with a dry hop appeal with a huge hop profile. It leaves a stinging pleasant aftertaste as it journeys down the throat. I really like the uniqueness of the this American IPA profile.","1666: 22oz bottle A- Pours a hazy amber color with an off-white head with decent retention and lacing. S- The aroma is sweet malt and some citrus notes from the centennial hops as well. The aroma is good, but a little more subdued than I was expecting. T- The taste like the aroma is smooth and malty up front with the hops coming in and lingering well into the finish. M- The mouthfeel is light bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. D- Overall, I enjoyed Hopportunity Knocks but I isn't a beer I would likely seek out again. Worth a try.","1668: On tap tonight at the Horse Brass. Nice looking orangy amber ale with a tiny white head that lasts no time, some lace left. Aroma is pleasant but nothing special ..of hops and malts with a touch or orange peel zest. The taste was exhilarating to start with the hops blending well with the orange peel falavours but after a while it bacame dullish,but themalts held throughout. Mouthfeel was rather on the thin side and average for style This is a nice beer but for once I think this would be better served quite chilled.","1679: Okay, pilseners aren't that hard to make, but being able to match what I drank in Germany? Well, that's a tall order. With that said, this reminded me of the beers I drank in Germany, when I favored the crisp, clean taste of a cold pilsener. The color is straw yellow and crystal-clear. The smell is light and floral, and the taste is crisp, malty-sweet and lightly hopped. In addition, the hops hit you then disappear. The mouthfeel is light, as a pilsener should be. Overall, an exceptional beer!","1682: poured into a tulip from a can with a two finger head and a deep copperish golden color with a slight reddish hue. smells like a slight twinge of alcohol and a floral yet citrusy hop aroma. and a sugary sweet malt backbone. Taste is bitterup front with a citrusy tongue with a sweet malt finish. relly quite impresive for my first craft beer from a can. super complex and tasty as hell. Mouth is suprisingly clean with a bite in the front. drinks moderately and really suprised me. For the cost I can't say it's worth it. 14.99 a six pack is steep for this one but it is a damn fine beer.","1690: Consumed 11\u002f4\u002f10 Got in a trade from ILikeBrew, thanks Micah for some Pacific Northwest Beer! Poured into Alchemist Brewery pint glass A: Pours clear dark orange with an inch of soapy head. Hangs to the glass pretty well to the bottom. S: Caramel malts, grapefruit, some pine resin T: Mild fruit up front, then the caramel\u002ftoasted malts in the middle. Finishes dry and bitter, nice punch. F: Slightly less than medium, with lower carbonation than I'd prefer. D: Pretty low carbonation for the big IPAs I'm used to drinking, so I could definitely do a few of these in a night.","1691: Poured from a 12oz. can into a standard pint glass Bright golden\u002forange, with a moderate, dense head of foam Aroma-Faint hop and citrus notes Taste-biscuit, citrus rind, subtle hop bite, grapefruit peel in the finish Overall, a nice, tasty, drinkable APA-out of a can","1693: 12oz can courtesy of Reino poured into a pint glass. Pours a clear light golden with a decent creamy white head that hung on as a cap for a while leaving good lacing. The aroma is very light with lots of lemony hops up front and a bit of bready malts as well. The flavor had the light citrus up front with the malts in the middle before giving way to some faint pine hop bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated and lighter than most pale ales. This is a very drinkable pale that doesn't have too much differentiation but is still tasty.","1694: A-Pours a clear gold with a thin white head and really good retention. S-Plentiful grapefruit hops with a solid malt backbone. T-Does not live up to the promise of the nose but still pleasant. Sweet malt in the front with a solid earthy hop finish. M-Medium bodied with light to medium carbonation. D-Nicely drinkable. HV","1697: appearance - light amber color, just a little darker than I expected from the nose, big frothy head. Smell - very nice hop, pine, some fruit taste - nice hoppy grapefruite taste, dry finish mouthfeel - very even, not too thin, not too chewy for a single ipa overall - solid, I doubt I will pay $12.99 again for this brew and it probably factored into my rating","1707: Aroma is absolutely heavenly - smoky with firm tones of quality coffee, molasses and sweet chocolate and a hint of licorice. It pours a deep, rich, warm opaque sable with a thick dark tan head that leaves some good lacing. Mouth filling flavor has a decided mocha core, quality coffee and chocolate plus licorice, molasses and even a bit of hoppy bitterness. Smooth flavor has a firm and biting fizz, and it leaves a smoky, slightly bitter, tingly finish. If ever you are in Oregon, grab a bottle - or better yet, grab two or three so you have something to trade.","1709: Exceptionally pale yellow with vigorous carbonation, a light white head, fogged body, and full abstract lace. This simple session lager has a sustained head, a light appealing aroma, and enough Saaz to keep your feet tapping. Could use a catchier name though. Served on tap at the Siskiyou Pub, Ashland, OR.","1717: 12oz bottle into pint glass. Pours a slightly hazy deep gold color with off-white head. Nose gives off notes of mango and grassiness with honey maltiness. Taste is mellow and spicy with notes of date and dried plums. Grassy and green hop presence with smooth bitterness. Moderate carbonation with a dry finish and lingering bitterness. Overall a nice pale ale that has a well-rounded (albeit bitter) flavor profile. Not as full-bodied as others, but good nonetheless.","1721: a- can poured into a pint, two finger off white head with nice retention, hazy tawny amber coloring. s- earthy hops, some pine, grapefruit pith, bitterness, slight malt. t- earthy, bitter grapefruit rind dominates, some pine, some lemon, tasty lingering bitterness as well. m- medium body, slick. d- good, i'd drink this again, but probably wouldn't seek out and buy. this is a solid canned craft ipa though.","1729: Orangeish with a peach head. Smell was hoppy. Taste was hoppy, not alot else going on. Not exciting but not boring either. It was easy to swallow but not alot else. Its something I could drink a few of. Good if you want a session beer but don't want a strong flavor.","1730: Interesting beer...not too sure how I feel about this. Looks good enough...cloudy orange with a decent white head. Malty, very floral smell. Creamy, light caramel scent. Light hops. Weird, floraly hop taste. Sour-ish after taste. Weird, bready character. Definitely can taste the rose, but its all muddled. Nothing really stands out. Slightly flat, not horrible. I think this would be better as a pint or a six pack, not a bomber.","1737: A 12 ounce can from a sixer I picked up at Abe's for $11. Poured into my Ithaca shaker glass. The IPA appears a super clear golden amber color with about a finger of off white foam. The head leaves a nice looking lace in its wake. Nose and flavors consist of bready, caramel malt, perfume, a bit of bitter grapefruit pith, lime, lemon, lightly toasted rolls. Medium bodied with adequate carbonation. I thought this would be super fresh and hoppy since this brewery just came into PA a week or so ago. I was a bit let down, especially judging by the reviews here. Needs more hops...","1738: More of a 'dry' than a lager, tasted at the 2002 Oregon Brewers Festival. Orange color, orange flavor in nose. Light malts and fairly aggressively hopped; yet it is not very bitter. Interesting taste, complex and subtle. Light yet flavorful. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Nice beer. Would be a great beer to sip during a hot summer day.","1741: 12oz can. A) Pours with a finger thick, white head that takes awhile to settle. Slightly hazy body. Active carbonation. Gold in color. Nice sticky lacing on the drink down. S) Pink grapefruit. A hint of evergreen. T) The initial flavors are washed out by the fizz. Once beyond that some dry nutty-ness liken to walnut. Grapefruit rind. A mellow sweetness throughout but not the main stay. A nice hop bite in the finish, but seems a bit too much for a pale ale. M) Quite fizzy. Medium body. Dry. D) A decent brew. I'd have another.","1752: Golden amber body with a solid finger of thick white head. Rather light for a Pale. Nose is light hops, grassy but tart. Flavor is lightly sweet, a moderate foundation of malt that balances the hops. Wonderful hops, tart C hops, but not overdone. A well balanced brew that is flavorful, yet still very quenching. Mouthfeel is tart and tangy. Drinkability is great! A very tasty and easily drinkable Pale. Bring me more!","1753: Pours out a pale straw like color with a bubbly 2 finger deep white head. Smells of light flowery Cascade hoppiness, pine, spruce, tropical. Flavor is soft bisquity maltiness, piney hops, faint caramel sweetness, earthy tone, nicely balanced. Crisp, clean, light to medium bodied, lingering bitterness. Highly drinkable. excellent summer session brew. Should be a campsite\u002fcooler standard.","1759: Standard lighter yellow pale ale here, good foamy head. Nice soft floral hop arrangement, if you like caldera, you'll be all good here. Plenty of taste in a pale, relative hefty amount of hops for style, light, ever so light toasting of the malt allows the hops to shine without making them exist in a ridiculous amount. Bitterness is sturdy, minty and metallic, but not a distraction or covering up the more delicate aspect of the beer, would say it leans to the grapefruit side of hop taste, cascade, chinook seem to be all over this one.","1764: Poured a deep copper hue with a one and a half finger foamy white head. There was good retention and lacing. The smell featured a full cereal grain, caramel and a citric hop. The taste was mainly hop driven with a grain full malt behind. Citus and pine dominated. Theouthfeel was typical of the style with a very dry finish. Overall a tasty hop driven west coast ale.","1773: 12oz can courtesy of Unclejedi, thanks! nice orange color with a foamy, sticky white head. Smells hoppy, resin, catty, nice. The taste is nicely balanced with the hops not really taking over just blending in to the picture. The mouthfeel is very smooth. Another example of good beer in a can.","1789: Poured from a can into a a Chouffe Flute A-Very deep nice amber\u002fdark copper laces thick and sticky down the glass, very sexy looking in the glass. S-very floral bitter hop smell. Grapefruit notes very citrusy. T-Much like the nose great bitterness in the front middle and back. Has a nice sweet malt quality in the middle, almost like a sweeter orange flavor very subtle but adds alot. M-Medium body near perfect on the carbonation. D-Only reason this is not a 5 is the price everything else about this beer on this section is flawless.","1801: Purchased in Portland during my spring break Pacific Northwest trip, the only bottle offering I've had from Caldera. Poured is a orange hued color. This IPA tastes maltier than the ones I used to have. Drinking at near room temperature made this even maltier-tasting, which isn't necessarily bad, but to me it tastes more like an amber than an IPA. It's a good beer but not outstanding.","1811: A: pours clear, pale orange maybe some yellow. The head is about a finger and a half of off white head. The head did settle down to a thin layer and did leave a good amount of lacing. S: malt is sweet, slightly grainy. Hops are a little piny, and a little bit grassy. T: again with the sweet lightly grainy malt. Hops bring about, mostly pine, a little citrus, and even some grass to the palate. M: carbonation is tingly and nice. Otherwise it smooth on the palate. O: yet another impressive brew from a can, good balanced flavor.","1821: 12 ounce can. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a hazy amber color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention is pretty good, and there is a lot of lacing left behind on the glass. Aroma is herbal and citrusy hops, along with a bit of sweet malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, it's mostly hops with some sweet malt noticable too. There's also a nice lingering bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel\u002fbody is medium, it's slick with moderate carbonation. It's easy enough to drink. I think it's a good solid IPA. I'd buy this one again in the future.","1825: Review is from notes. Picked this up while visiting family in pennsylvania. A: Dark yellow, good head, great pour S: Hops, sugar, some floral T: Bitter up front, malt balances nicely M: A bit bubbbly for my taste. Needs a little less carbonation D: Ok. Not the best pale ale but decent.","1828: Eh. A little surprised at the rating here. Pours a copper, reddish orange. Definitely not the familiar yellowish, golden orange of most IPAs. Large off-white head. Smells faintly of pine, more strongly of ... well, citrus. Not quite grapefruit, just citrus-y. And there's maybe a whiff of malt. Well, maybe not. There's a strange toasted after-taste to the malt, and the hop flavoring is a touch muted. Really more like a pale ale than an ipa to me, though not quite that either. Some grapefruit, some random-y citrus notes, and a touch of sweet malt. Decent, but nothing to write home about.","1831: A-Pours an orange\u002famber color with a dense, pillowy, white, one finger head. S-Grapefruit, pine and mango with some pineapple and light carmale notes. T-Bitter pine, pineapple, some grapefruit with light malt and a dry bitter finish. M-Pretty crisp and dry in the mouthfeel with medium body and pirckly, but low carbonation. D-Really nice IPA. It has most of the things that I look for in an IPA: some malt backbone, a nice bitter hop burst and a great fragrant nose.","1835: Attractive amber in the tulip glass with very nice head and lacing. Modest aroma. Initial taste is promising. A touch of sweet malt but mostly it's the heavy hand of hops. Sharp and acidic on the palate. Some aromatics with a flowery touch, but mostly just bitter. Aftertaste goes on and on. Unrelieved bitterness with not much interest to go with it. Not very drinkable. I am trying to find something good to say about this beer, since it's clean and well made. But for IPA lovers, it's definitely in the zone.","1846: Bought a 6 pack at my local grocery store. Poured into a stone nonic. A very pretty and pretty tastey IPA. Comes through with some thick texture and dark fruit flavor initially and transforms into juicy hops finishing with a tad of extreme bitterness. A really well rounded, perfectly B+ IPA that is very cost effective if you're looking for something to knock a few back of and enjoy.","1849: Complex enjoyable smoked. Tasty rich malt,caramel, woody,spicey, and balanced. Leans a tad to sweetness rather than bitterness. The smoke is significant in the aroma but not overwhelming. Above average mouthfeel. Yellow coloured body. Most drinkable.Thanks Augustgarage.","1850: A: pours amber orange with a decent finger of off white head. S: grapefruit and light pine, and floral hop. There is some malt sweetness in the background. T: a nice tounge coating hop, that is piny, a citrus cross between grapefruit and orange. Malt is light but nicely sweet. M: coating hop, though the malt is light in the mouth, good carbonation. O: canned beer is really starting to grow on me, and leaves me impressed enough to try calderas other offerings","1855: Good IPA and in a can!!! Pours a light amber\u002fgolden clear color with a medium sized frothy white head. Average retention and thick rings of lacing. Smell includes piney and citrus hops. Prominent and good. Tastes good as well. Piney and citrus hops and enough malt to be able to say balanced. The hops win out and the beer is still bitter but also smooth, crisp and easy to drink. Mouthfeel is crisp and starts out a bit thin. But like many IPAs, the hops coat the tongue and make the beer appear more rich. Drinkability is good. Good tasting, balanced and smooth.","1856: Sampled from a can with no freshness date. Big billowy off-white head with decent retention. Burnt orange in color. Medium bodied with an oily feel and aggressive carbonation. Solid caramel malty aroma with a hint of citrusy grapfruit hop flavor near the finish. Orange citrus flavores up front that transitions to bitter pine hop flavor that quickly follows thru the middle and to the finish. Noce caramel malt undertone throughout. Decent hop character and balance but lacked the hop intensity of a really goof IPA.","1859: Thanks to bman1113vr for sharing this bottle. The beer pours a clear brown color with a tan head. The aroma is heavy on the toffee and not too much else. The flavor is toffee, leather, tobacco, wood and dark fruit. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A decent beer but nothing too exciting.","1863: Ruddy read pour with 2 fingers of cream head. Great retention and thick strands of lace. Floral hop nose. Woody, earthy mix. Bread malt thrown in for good measure. Taste is hop esthers, with light resin and oil. Also a surprise with a taste of strawberry licorice. Thick, chewy body for the style. I'd get this again.","1871: Poured from the can a clear golden hue with two fingers of bright white head. Good lacing all around. Aroma is slightly sour and malty much like a pilsner. A slight whiff of sulfur and vegetables as well. The taste has a bitter edge along with malt and biscuit. Lighter bodied, dry, and moderately carbonated. Pretty drinkable, but this is a fairly decent pale ale that sits in the middle of the pack.","1885: This is a great beer in the canned beer arena. Had no option but to drink this straight from the can so I can't comment on appearance. Had a nice scent of bitter citrus and pine. Hops contribute a moderate bitterness consisting of both grapefruit and pine flavors, on top of a lightly sweet pale malt backbone.. Mouthfeel was crisp and pleasing with generous carbonation. Had a couple of these on a hike and found them to be great for the occasion.","1893: Smell is light, almost non-existent, must be trapped in the dark amber. Very light head tops a thin effervescent surface. Taste is belgian yet bitter, with very little of the promised oranges. I'm getting a lot of roast out of this, which normally would be a compliment but it just doesn't fit what I was expecting. Aside from the bitter notes the beer is pretty good, it's almost like a belgian strong dark coffee stout ale.","1905: Clear dark amber with a good three finger white head. Plentiful lacings. Aroma is fruity citrus hops with a bit of leather. Taste is full deep leathery bitter hops with the correct amount of malts. The label describes \"centennial hops\" as the mainstay of all that bitterness. Mouthfeel is just right, and drinkability is very good for this style. Kudos to Caldera for daring to bottle a limited production beer. Their normal regimen is cans. Cool label. Give the fellows from the \"State of Jefferson\" a big thumbs up! Keep it coming Caldera!","1907: Poured into an imperial nonic a clear copper with a great one finger sticky white head that nver really leaves,a frothy mass is there during the whole duration of the glass.Big caramel malt in the nose with subdued citric hops,a little hop oomph and it would be great.Citric and herbal hops play against a big caramel\u002fbiscuit malt base with neither getting the upper heand really.There is a little lightly roasted nuttiness in the malt profile as well.A beer thats oh so close to being stellar,just bump up the hop profile and there you go,as is its pretty good.","1916: Thanks Woody! Poured a very orange\u002fcopper brew with 1 finger of head that faded quickly leaving decent lacing. Smell was light citrusy\u002fpine hop combo. Taste was bigger on the pine but accented with nicely with citrus Mouthfeel was medium to full nice and chewy for an IPA Drinkability is good something you could put a few back of and relax with nothing that made me go WOW I need to get this again though.","1919: Appearance - Pours a pale golden color with about a finger of quickly dissipating head that leaves little lacing on the edges of the glass. Smell - Light hops, grainy malts, breadyness. Taste - Taste is similar to the nose with a hint of caramel\u002fhoney. Nothing really stands out to me as special, but then again what do you expect with the description on the side of this. Mouthfeel - Light bodied, prickly carbonation. Drinkability - Quite drinkable to be honest, however as someone else stated, might as well buy some PBR's rather than spend money on this.","1920: The hopportunity knocks poured a copper color with a 2-3 finger foam head with decent retention. The nose is high on citrus since on the bottle it mentions solely Centennial. You also get a little sweetness. Solid malt backbone with a moderate bitterness. Not over the top but manageable. In the mouth it tickles the roof of the mouth and leaves a mark on tongue. Overall a good offering in a bottle from the boys down south.","1933: A- is cloudy and light glassy goldeness S- smell of light winter pine needles and small delicate floral hints T- the taste is light and easy to drink, very winter like in the beginning. Reminds me of being in a forest and then at the end your hit with small hints of flower flavor. M- easy to the tounge and flows with 2 waves of flavor. Both are easy and satisfying. O- this is a very unique beer and I would recommend it to any one for a very different drinking experience. It easy and I would drink this beer in the winter or spring. Its very light and still has a pretty high alcohol%.","1938: Poured this 12 oz. can into a Sam Adams glass. No date. The body was pale gold. The head was modest and bright white leaving only bits of lace. Smell was a pungent, leafy, skunky hops - yum!. Tea, which was strong but faded. Taste was green and grassy with a nice lingering bitter finish. Not hasrsh, but flavorful. Enough biscuity malts to give it some pale ale balance. Very solid and highly drinkable. Mouthfeel was medium to light in body. Adequate carbonation, finishes pretty smooth. (My 700th review)","1940: Reddish amber with good clarity. Modest head that leaves light lacing. Pretty color, but fairly unusual for an IPA. Pleasant nose but more malty than hoppy - graham cracker maybe? Herbal hop character with moderate lingering bitterness. A bit metallic. Medium bodied. A bit juicy but metallic bitterness builds to dominate the impression.","1960: Pours a pale straw gold with a frothy light 2 finger head. Decent retention. Good lacing. Nice carbonation. Nose is faint, with pine and light citrus coming through. Slightly yeasty. Very sharp on the tongue. Bitter, but more than hops contributing to this aspect of the flavor. Odd that the bitterness tends to fade before the taste does.","1971: Served in a pint glass This beer pours a blackness with a beige foam head. The smell while not greatly profound does carry notes of blackened malts and bitter coffee. There is a touch of licorice in the nose as well. The taste mostly reminds of a bad cup of coffee. There is a distinct coffee flavor but mostly it's backed up by a burnt char flavor that lasts into the aftertaste. There is a nice medium sticky mouthfeel to the beer as well. It's drinkable, but only as it warms to room temperature. The only bitterness that I really can't get past is a burnt bitterness and it's pretty palatable in this beer and is really the only reason I was not too fond of it.","1976: Nice light orange\u002famber color with lots of head. Big pine and grapefruit nose that screams bright hop flavor will follow, and it does. Taste follows the nose with big grapefruit notes that are followed by tangerine, pine, and maybe a slight pineapple at the end. Malt is light, slightly sweet, and lets the hops shine through very nicely. Not aggressively bitter but bitter enough to make you sip it a little slower, not offensive at all. Very drinkable, nicely priced, and always available where I am, making this one a regular for me.","36: 22 oz. bomber, A: Pours a clear yellow with a mild white head, good retention. S: Great nose of ginger, honey, perfume. T: Rather light upfront, it reminds me of Lawnmower, with a hint of ale fruitiness\u002fKolsch-like almost. Good ginger honey notes on the back end, not taking over the beer in any way. The ginger flavour is clear, but I wanted it to come out a little more in the end. M: Very light-bodied, watery, light base beer for sure. D: An easy drinking spiced beer, this will offend no one, but there's not a complexity to this brew at all.","404: 22 oz bomber. Slight aroma of bread, light whiffs of cheese for some reason. Ugly looking beer..insipid pee colour..least the small white head hangs around. Taste papery, bread, some lemongrass. Really very little to it Macro-lager palate to it..average. Overall pretty bad stuff here.' Get a 40 of MHL or PBR save you money.","839: My first beer from this brew...and what a goodie! Over a finger of off-white head lingers over a translucent amber. The head lives a good amount of sticky lacing all over the glass. Aromas of floral and herbal hops with a sweet but bready maltiness as a distance backbone. Earthy notes in both the aroma and taste. Tons of bitter residuals linger on the palate, thanks in part to a medium mouthfeel. This is a delicious IPA, and I look forward to grabbing more cans from this brewery!","873: I'm guessing a bit with the style on this one. I suspect it is intended as a fruit beer. The orange in the name is certainly reflected in the taste and nose as well as the colour. I found this on-tap at Kelly's Olympian and certainly hasn't been there for more than a fortnight. This brew works well. It is dry and hoppy as the name suggests, and the orange doesn't ruin this by making it too sweet. Think peel rather than juice. It is surprisingly refreshing and drinkable for such a dry beer. Not frou-frou.","1065: Split the bomber with my girlfriend who picked it out because of the roses. Pours a clear gold\u002forange with a small white head. Smells floral as expected with some malty sweetness too. Not really picking up heavy roses on the nose. Tastes weirdly floral, but not good floral like a heavily cascade hopped beer. Hardly any hops at all, just a weird rose flavor. Good news is if I ever want this flavor again, I have a large rose bush in my front yard. Undercarbonation leads to an even worse experience. My first drain pour in quite a while. After a few sips these became way too overpowering and going through 22 oz wasn't happening.","1111: Bomber pours a clear straw yellow body with a small vanilla head that quickly drops into some scattered lacing. Aroma has some crackery malt and a hint of floral hops. Mouthfeel is light bodied with a spritzy carbonation. Taste is dominated by a crackery pilsner type maltiness that is balanced by a dry grassy and floral hoppiness. Reminds me of kolsch. Unpretentious and unoffensive. A decent lawn mower beer, I suppose.","1211: 22 oz bottle from \"Lifesource\" Salem. $3.95 Nice golden clear beer body with a nice sized frothy\u002fcreamy white head. Ok aromas..mainlly a bit of ginger speice and some bready malt..simple nice Taste very nice indeed..nice spicy ginger backed with slightly caramel maltiness..simple again but i like . Liked the mouthfeel of this one..very forward carbonation which helps the ginger effect and a lingering ginger in the after taste. Overall a simple ginger brew .I liked it","1309: I'm not sure why I picked this up... I like ginger, and it was reasonably cheap compared to the other beers I was looking at. Pours a pale golden color with smallish head. Nose is largely uneventful, some ginger in there, a bit of pear, but mainly normal lager. Taste is pretty good, bringing a bit more of the ginger to the fore. MF was a bit fizzy, not terrible though. Easy drinker, I had no problem finishing the bomber. Interesting, but I probably won't get it again.","1336: 22 oz. bomber, A: Pours a clear yellow with a mild white head, good retention. S: Great nose of ginger, honey, perfume. T: Rather light upfront, it reminds me of Lawnmower, with a hint of ale fruitiness\u002fKolsch-like almost. Good ginger honey notes on the back end, not taking over the beer in any way. The ginger flavour is clear, but I wanted it to come out a little more in the end. M: Very light-bodied, watery, light base beer for sure. D: An easy drinking spiced beer, this will offend no one, but there's not a complexity to this brew at all.","1386: Vintage 2010. A: Quarter finger light mocha fades to translucent of the same. Beer is dark, dark brown. No lacing to speak of. S: Extra roasty. Coffee, graham, cocoa, malt, licorice. I can say, however, the hops are still quite present. Piney, resiny. Malt dominant, but still hoppy. T: Roast, cocoa, coffee, lighter hops with earthy feel. Good beer. Not spending much time here, but this is really good. M: thick and syrupy. Like a good beer should be in this genre. D: this is a really good beer. I hate to be a slave to price point, but at nearly $13 for a bomber, I want to be wowed. The beer is good, really really good. If under $9\u002fbomber, I would be all about this one.","1403: Poured from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass, the beer has a deep red-copper color with a small, thin 1\u002f2\" head that dissipates quickly. The beer is heavily smelling of hops and floral, with a little bit of a smokey background. The hops flavor hits the middle of the tongue, and there is a very short lasting, bitter undertone to it. There is a bitter and at the same time sour aftertaste to the finish, and the bitter portion of that will linger from some time after the beer is gone. It's a heavy IPA that is full of flavor in mouth, but the lingering aftertaste makes this a \"one and done\" for me. I thoroughly enjoy this beer, but one bomber at a time.","1709: Exceptionally pale yellow with vigorous carbonation, a light white head, fogged body, and full abstract lace. This simple session lager has a sustained head, a light appealing aroma, and enough Saaz to keep your feet tapping. Could use a catchier name though. Served on tap at the Siskiyou Pub, Ashland, OR.","1765: 22 oz. bomber, A: Pours a pale yellow, soft white head, fairly good retention per the style. S: Some grainy malt notes, light hops, mild inoffensive nose. T: Direct pilsner esque barley malt flavour, light hopping. Again, mild but the malt flavour is good. M: Light-bodied, crisp, very clean, refreshing. D: A solid pale lager, not as much flavour as I wanted, maybe akin to Full Sail Session is what I was looking for. As an innocuous easy drinking lager it did its job.","179: Strong hop bittering married to a coffee-enhanced roastiness with a surprising malt turnaround towards the finish. This stout is black as it gets with modest brown head and lace. The mouthfeel is notably well contoured. The flavor and aroma of this 2004 winter seasonal approach being outright carbonized. You can almost literally taste the blackness of this doubly roasted brew. Dark and hearty though at times cloying.","254: Pour was a surprisingly murky yet bright caramel color with an aggressive, sticky head. Big hops flavor up front - broadly bitter with floral and herbal notes, finishing up with a bit of pine resin. Substantial malt flavor, leaning toward caramel malt and a bit of toffee. Mouthfeel was almost chewy - no one will accuse this beer of being overly filtered.","360: A- black with thin tan head. Good lace S- sweet, slight hint of esters\u002ffruit, roasted malt...typical porter nose T- similar to nose. Initial slight estery\u002ffruitiness transitions smoothly to roasty-sweet, coffee\u002fchocolate finish. One of the best balances of hops-malt I've had in a porter. M- full bodied, silky and slightly creamy. Perfect for the style. D- very sessionable....very close to perfect for the style","1021: Wonderful fluffy full headed porter. Great esspresso aromas, roasted coffee. Salty under taste..this is minor yet sets the theme for the porter..the saltiness makes you gulp more of the chocolaty ,.coffee goodness. Great drinking beer..with great backing.","1321: Tap handle red \"Dry Hop Orange\" but alas, here we go. Warm hoppy sack of Mt. Hood on the nose. Citrus and Oranges rise up to the nearly caustic bitterness. Thinish mouthfeel, but damned drinkable. Amazing blend of malt and hop gives this a shockingly Orange Juice like flavor. I was convinced this was a fruit\u002fvegetable beer, and my notes end with \"blows ApriHop out of the water\". Hey, it was a long night of beer tasting ... still this was one tasty brew to quaff through the hot Portland summer night.","1386: Vintage 2010. A: Quarter finger light mocha fades to translucent of the same. Beer is dark, dark brown. No lacing to speak of. S: Extra roasty. Coffee, graham, cocoa, malt, licorice. I can say, however, the hops are still quite present. Piney, resiny. Malt dominant, but still hoppy. T: Roast, cocoa, coffee, lighter hops with earthy feel. Good beer. Not spending much time here, but this is really good. M: thick and syrupy. Like a good beer should be in this genre. D: this is a really good beer. I hate to be a slave to price point, but at nearly $13 for a bomber, I want to be wowed. The beer is good, really really good. If under $9\u002fbomber, I would be all about this one.","1436: Brown in color, somewhere between a porter and a brown ale. Lacking in aroma, but no off stuff. Same with the taste, lacking flavor, complexity, just went with smoothness. No off flavors though, so I can't say this is bad, just unadventurous, especially for Caldera, whom I think is generally underrated. You really have to search to pull anything out of this in terms of the usual chocolate\u002fcoffee flavors, really, the only thing I can tell is that the oats did their job, because this is smooth and unoffensive. Other than that, extremely pedestrian.","1736: Delicious full bodied stout with all the trimmings. Leather, wood, tobacco, sugary fruit. The nice thing about Old Growth is that you can savor the \"mature\" end of the taste spectrum without having to be knocked out by a 12%+ abv. Caldera's move into the richer end of the spectrum is exciting, looking forward to their future beers ! This beer is a great seasonal, not trying to dethrone abyss, but a great addition to the fall\u002fwinter lineup.","194: Pours nice, great head retention, no nose at all. Nice 1st hit bitter followed by what I thought would be a little sweet malty finish. Wrong at death a killer long lasting bitter hit on the back of the tounge. The finish lasts forever. Overall not a killer IPA, but certinly a very tasty drinkable brew that's a lot different than Caldera IPA. I like it, worth a try, if you like IPA's.","102: 12 oz bottle poured into Sam Adams glass. Good head and lacing, pours a deep amber. Aroma is citrus piney hops, with a bit of toffee. Taste has a great hop profile, bitter piney yet plenty of flavorful citrus fruit as well. Dry finish, medium viscosity. Overall a very nice west coast style IPA.","103: Pours a dark amber with a moderate head. Smell is pretty nice! Pine and tropical fruits. Taste starts with a nice blend of bitter pine and fruit punch, without being overly sweet. Pretty dry finish, medium-light mouth. This is a nice little surprise and drinkable but not complex enough to be interesting beyond one. But overall for what it is, Caldera has a winner.","558: Thanks to Kegatron for hooking me up with a can. Pours a clear amber color with 3 fingers of tall foamy off-white head. Great retention leaves lots of lacing stick. Smells of caramel, pine, grapefruit, and spicy hops. Tastes of toasted grains, caramel, citrus fruits, and bitter spicy and earthy hops in the finish. Medium in body with good carbonation. Crisp and balanced with a nice woodsy bitter finish. Easy to drink and enjoyable. A solid sessionable IPA that has me looking forward to trying more stuff from Caldera.","1002: Pours a clear burned orange with a creamy head that dies somewhat quickly and little to no lacing. Smells like a hop bomb with strong citrus, rind and a tiny bit of floral. Blows away your taste buds with hops and a bite of citrus. The balance isnt as great as it could be but this sure is tasty, especially if you are a hop head. Finishes wonderfully dry and bitter but doesnt linger too long on the tongue. Carbonation is perfect. A very drinkable and delicious IPA....and from a can no less.","1009: Pours a clear gold color, with a big impressive white head. Nice hoppy cascade nose. Floral, and pine like. Beer has a pretty light quality. But is still tasty. Light crisp hop flavor, a bit of malty sweetness and creaminess, and a slightly piney and resiny hop finish. Nice simple APA. Mouthfeel is pretty good. As mentioned, it's a bit light, but still feels nice in the mouth. Drinkability is very good. Light and easy drinking, yet still a tasty APA. Session worthy. I love canned craft beer!","1201: What's this? Caldera brew in a bottle! Who knew?! I thought they were strictly about the can, but I stand corrected. The pour is a nice copper color with a thin layer of head that vanishes quickly, and the lacing is minimal. Citrus hops along side mild malts on the nose. Mouthfeel is medium with a nice amount of carb. The flavor is good and hoppy; nice and bitter! This is not a beginner's ale, so if you are new to the micro game, this may not be the beer for you. Since this is a Caldera brew, it could EASILY pass for an IPA. Overall drinkability is great. I really like this and could easily sit down with a few of these on a weekend with friends and a barbeque.","1240: A: Pours to a frothey tan head with a deep and beautiful copper body. Excellent lacing. S: Slight, hoppy, piney aroma. T: Citrusy with piney hops. Crisp and not real bitter but it does have a slight bite with lasting flavor. The hops definitely comes through. A nice IPA that doesn't knock you over. Typically what an IPA is suppose to be. M: Lightly carbonated, smooth and thin. Not watery or oily. D: Refreshing and while not a session beer, you can easily enjoy a couple of these without any problems. One of the better canned micro-brews that I have tried.","1273: Was expecting it to be tasty, and tasty it was indeed. Nice golden orange appearance, hardly any head. ** Taste is above par for an American IPA, I could throw back many of these no problem. This is a great little IPA, and will be coming back to it time and time again.","1277: Overall a really nice and interesting beer. I saw this on the shelf and hadn't tried anything yet from this brewery but looked interesting. Figured I would try it. It was really a nice beer. It definitely had a lot of smoky and meaty flavor to it! Very interesting and nice beer overall, I would drink it again.","1289: Review is from notes A: Orange, cloudy, head sticks around a while S: Smells like cat piss (not a bad thing strangely),very floral, hoppy T: Bitter up front, nice malt back, M: Easy to drink - mild carbonation D: All day long. Great offering from Caldera considering their PA wasn't all that great.","1290: Great looking 12oz can poured into pint glass. Pours a golden amber color with tons of frothy head and gobs of lacing on the sides of the glass. Very piney hoppy smell. Taste is a slap in the tongue with pine followed by orange citrus. Amazing hop profile on par with super hopped double\u002fimperial IPA's. Light dry mouthfeel that really dries out your mouth. Great drinkability hindered only by the hop blast that will quickly leave your taste buds dulled. Overall this is an amazing IPA that blows my mind every time I drink it.","1352: This one is eclipsed by the regular Caldera IPA that comes in a can unfortunately... I was looking for a more pronounced citrus bitterness and this was more floral and fragrant in nature... A different animal altogether and this somehow missed the mark for me... A fairly average brew with just a nint of hops to it and this bottle should be pretty fresh... This wasn't bad, mind you, but it just tasted and felt rather run of the mill to me...","1585: I got this one as an extra from one of those awesome West Coast BAs! Thanks! This one pours a nice golden color with an off-whie head. Nice lacing that lasts. Upon popping the top I was hit immediately by a cascate of hoppy smells coming from the can. Smells delicious with the malt to balance things nicely. The taste follows the nose with a nice, crisp finish. In the mouth this one is nice and creamy. This is a highly drinkable beer. It has a nice hoppy dry finish that keeps your mouth wanting more.","1801: Purchased in Portland during my spring break Pacific Northwest trip, the only bottle offering I've had from Caldera. Poured is a orange hued color. This IPA tastes maltier than the ones I used to have. Drinking at near room temperature made this even maltier-tasting, which isn't necessarily bad, but to me it tastes more like an amber than an IPA. It's a good beer but not outstanding.","288: Orange color for a beer with orange in the name. Minimal head, its all good. Definite citrus (orange?) hop impressions here. Pleasant. Dry taste, moderate bitterness, full hop mouthfeel. Easy to drink. Not overpowering hop presence, but good nonetheless, gives it the delicate and on point treatment moreso than just simplistic bitter brutality. Crystal and caramel malt seem to be kicking it here. Stayed away from sweet territory. Definitely gets its orange name from the hop impressions, not the addition of fruit.","10: A: poured a caramel brown with a thin head that left a little bit of sticky lacing on the glass. S: at first I get caramel aromas with a underlying floral hop notes which had a good malt presence. There was also some citrus and bready notes as well. T: some nice piney hops pop out on the taste with caramel and citrus grapefruit accents that help out on the bitterness. It seems to have a decent malt backbone that helps out the balance. M: medium body with a low amount of carbonation that still works out but had a slight sweet and bitter hop finish. D: pretty good IPA that drank well and had a good amount of sweetness but lacked on the hop punch. It was still a tasty brew.","43: Had this on 2011-09-23 in Lynchburg, VA A - Almost clear, orange-amber with a 2-finger off-white head with big bubbles and moderate lacing. S - Fairly strong aroma that can be smelled 18\" away. Sweet malt, citrus and hop floral. T - Much like the aroma. Sweet bread and fruit followed by a dash of orange flesh a touch of spice and finally orange rind bitterness doesn't dominate. A pleasant, well-balanced bitter-sweet taste although it doesn't blow my hair back. M - Medium body and carbonation. A bit syrupy with some prickle O - I enjoyed this brew. It has a lot of flavor for being 6.1% ABV.","57: Again folks, I do enjoy a fruit beer every now and then, and this was a pretty decent brew, just not a stand out. A - pours an average reddish gold hue with light carbonation and a thin head S - Actually nice on the nose, delicate perfume with ginger, honey, and flowers up front. T - Pretty good, though nothing special, kind of girly, but would be nice to drink at the pool or beach M - light bodied and lacks stuffing, lots of acidity up front D - gets rather boring and a little too tedious after the first few sips.","64: Can. Great for shooting empty bottles in the desert. Orange color. Yummy dry hop aroma, fruity too. Good taste, not tongue numbing hops or bitterness, just the right amount for an active outdoor lifestyle for this ipa. Right amount of sweetness. Not heavy on the palate at all. Good summer ipa. Nothing outlandish mouthfeel wise. $10 a 6 was difficult at first, but seems to be a decent price after all.","255: Awsome yellow can caught my eye. Bought at the Sacramento Co-op which is behind my house. a: I drank the first two out of the can. For some reason I really like drinking out of a can. Pours a nices light brown color in to a pint glass. Has a full head. s: Leans on the bisquity side. I'm feeling Nectar IPA here. Good, dirty, malty nose taste: Really nice bend of malts and hops here. Again can't help but think of nectar IPA, one of my favorites. This beer hits the spot with that wonderful mix of malt and hop flavors. m and d: The drinkablity is great due to the light mouth feel on this beer.","266: Lovely orange-tan color, great lasting head, and plenty of lacing. A nice biscuit-malt aroma with crisp, fresh hops. Tastes like a great malty background with delectable hoppy bitter flavors dancing on your tongue. No shortage of pine or grapefruit either. Very balanced and flavorful. Easy to drink, with a good blend of ingredients producing a rich, smooth beer creation. Definitely a likable brew.","312: This bottle was hand delivered from my brother who lives in Portland, OR. The beers pours a deep burnt orange color with a small white head. Very nice lacing on the glass. The dominant smell is of sweet caramel. Taste is also sweet caramel with a strong earthly, almost dirty, hop finish that hangs! A decent beer, but much more malty than I would expect from a beer called Hopportunity Knocks.","423: Light orange body under one finger slowly dissapating white head, exceptional lacing. Floral hops in the nose with light sweetness of malt, not too sweet. A very nice balance of grassy, grapefruit hops with delicate malty overtones on the taste buds. Nice carbonation in mouthfeel, and a very drinkable brew. A very pleasant surprise, looking forward to trying this in cans on a hot summer day.","446: A-Gold-light bronze. Big eggshell head. Brilliantly clear. S-Piney, citrusy hops. Crackers. Slight soapiness after a while. T-citrus rinds, some pine. Firm bitterness. Bitterness hides much of the malt but some crackery malt comes through. M-medium light bodied. Medium carbonation. No alcohol burn. really nice. D-Really nice beer. A bit on the bitter side to drink all night but a really tasty beer.","486: Apperance: Orange-y, light amber. Lacing left on the glass. Smell: Nice citrus hop aroma thats pretty minimal of a NW IPA, a nice chance. Taste: Malt flavor is rapidly replaced with a pretty bitter lasting hop finish. T Mouthfeel: darn easy drink.... Drinkability: Tasty beer, Id drink this again.","488: The beer pours a hazy dark golden\u002famber color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pale and Carapils scent along with a huge citrus hop aroma. There is a light breadiness as well. The taste is very good. It's light with a damn bitter hop taste. It's loaded with citrus goodness. The malt bill provides some balance, but this is a hop heavy beer. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great session IPA. It refreshingly hoppy and easily drinkable.","491: Super clear orange body with a frothy sticky head that lasts the whole beer, very impressive appearance. Smells sweet, pine, citrus, biscuity, earthy. Taste is very malty with very little bitterness which i was not expecting as this is an IPA and should have more hop profile the taste. A little too malty for my liking.","649: A-Full bronze. big light tan head. brilliantly clear. S-Some toasty malt. Light citrus hop aroma. Not a lot going on. T-Carmelly malty. Firm bitterness but more balanced to the malt than their Pale ale. Not much in the way of hop flavor. Lots of bitterness but not much flavor. M-medium bodied. medium carbonation. No alcohol burn. D-An average tasting IPA. Needs more hop flavor and aroma. Bitterness and malt are spot on. Still not a bad beer.","660: Can from Beerzack. Thanks! Pours Semi-clear reddish amber witha big lasting chunky whitish head that leaves lots of lacing. Smell is sweet fruity, fresh and hoppy. Very nice. Taste is smooth with fruity caramel and fresh citrusy, and sweet orange flavored hops and bitter citrus rind. Nice and strongly bittered which lasts in the finish but with a light lingering sweetness too. Very good IPA.","722: Nice dark orange colured ale, small lightv tan head. I dont like the aroma, it certainlly has hops aplenty, but has a sour ,sweaty work sock aroma that puts me off in the background. The flavor is better, very strong oniony hopping, pink grapefruit and spruce tips. Thin and maybe even a tad under carbonated. I dint really dig this one. I liked their Pale Ale way better.","730: A: Poured from a can to a pint glass. Had an orangey color and a cloudy texture. There was a half inch of foamy, long-lasting head and very good lacing. S: A nice aroma of citrus, hops, and a slight maltiness. T: Tasted of hops, pine, citrus, and some caramel malt. A very Western-type flavor for an IPA. M: A well-carbonated beer with a dry, crisp finish. Medium-bodied. D: A very drinkable beer that helps to dispell the myth that only bad beers come in cans.","832: Hazy apricot color with a solid frothy eggshell colored head with great retention and lacing. Visible carb at the edges. Nice floral and grapefruit hop notes on the nose. Good clean flavors. Nice mild hop notes up front with the same characteristics as the nose balanced well with the middle-backended caramel maltiness. Hops create a slightly bitter aftertaste. Mouth is crisp with a bit of a zip and high carb. Overall it's a good pale ale. A perfect beer to have in a can like it is, being a perfect beer to have while camping, golfing, fishing etc.","839: My first beer from this brew...and what a goodie! Over a finger of off-white head lingers over a translucent amber. The head lives a good amount of sticky lacing all over the glass. Aromas of floral and herbal hops with a sweet but bready maltiness as a distance backbone. Earthy notes in both the aroma and taste. Tons of bitter residuals linger on the palate, thanks in part to a medium mouthfeel. This is a delicious IPA, and I look forward to grabbing more cans from this brewery!","856: 12oz can $2. I did not care for this beer. It looked good, orange, pale, good lace, decent head. It smelled kind of weak but not bad. It tasted like stale iced tea and I did not care for that flavor one bit. The IPA I had from this brewer was much better than this. For my money I'd stick with Full Sail Pale Ale for a couple dollars less.","873: I'm guessing a bit with the style on this one. I suspect it is intended as a fruit beer. The orange in the name is certainly reflected in the taste and nose as well as the colour. I found this on-tap at Kelly's Olympian and certainly hasn't been there for more than a fortnight. This brew works well. It is dry and hoppy as the name suggests, and the orange doesn't ruin this by making it too sweet. Think peel rather than juice. It is surprisingly refreshing and drinkable for such a dry beer. Not frou-frou.","887: Decidedly crimson, clear, with just under a finger of slightly off-white head with lowish retention. Good citrus-Cascade nose, but not quite as strong as I would have expected. A straightforward, dryish, slightly caramelly amber ale with a good dose of citrus hop flavor. Nothing too complicated, and entirely pleasing, though I found myself yearning for just a little more malt in the background. I love it when hop juice becomes hop syrup...","976: 12 oz. can with a slightly different look from the one shown above. No freshness date Poured a bright, clear orange with a half-inch white head. Very subdued fruity aromas which quickly fade. This is the least impressive character of this ale. The ale begins with a pleasant bitterness that lingers on the tongue. There is a very faint metallic flavor that quickly faded. Overall, this is dry and refreshing. Noticeably carbonated with a light body. The mouthfeel is clean and refreshing. While not very complex, this is a summer quaffer with its light, refreshing body and slight fruity bitterness.","1002: Pours a clear burned orange with a creamy head that dies somewhat quickly and little to no lacing. Smells like a hop bomb with strong citrus, rind and a tiny bit of floral. Blows away your taste buds with hops and a bite of citrus. The balance isnt as great as it could be but this sure is tasty, especially if you are a hop head. Finishes wonderfully dry and bitter but doesnt linger too long on the tongue. Carbonation is perfect. A very drinkable and delicious IPA....and from a can no less.","1031: Tapped this open and a fruity piney smell, Cloudy golden orange color when poured in a pint glass. Nice foaming thick head. Big and hoppy, yet smooth as butter. Minimal hop after taste (I like this, so was a liittle disappointed with the lack there of there) However, a delicious beer. Would drink it anytime!! I bet on draft it is a delight!","1064: Poured into tulip glass. Appearance: Deep mahogany with red hue, pours 1 finger of off-white head that fades quickly. Lots of lacing. Smell: Roasted malt, chocolate, orange zest, slightly boozy as it warms, raw sugars. Taste: roasted malt, chocolate, blood orange, sweet, brown sugar. Mouthfeel: full bodied, good carbonation. Overall: A tasty porter. I like the subtle blood orange element. Not a lot going on here, but what there is is quite good. Drinkability is above average.","1121: A- Aggressive pour yields a three inch off white head. Beer itself is a somewhat cloudy dull light orange. Awesome head retention with above average lacing. S- Bright citrus notes...think lemons, oranges. T- Follows the nose. With a noticeable, but not overpowering, dose of hops on the back end. Well balanced. Alcoholic orange juice, mmmph. M- Medium mouthfeel. Carbonation is lacking a bit it seems. D\u002fO- One of the better pale ales I've had in awhile. Drinkability is the tits...and in cans no less! First Caldera offering is a winner in my book.","1126: Poured from a can into a pint glass A - Amber in color with a thick, off-white head. S - Not as much hop aroma as I had hoped. There is some citrusy hop aroma and a bit of stickiness to it. T - better hop character in the taste. Good malt backbone to balance the hops. The finish is a bit chalky and biscuity. M - The biscuitiness interferes with the mouthfeel to me. A bit too thick on the tongue for an IPA. D - Nothing unpleasant about the way this one goes down. Alcohol is well masked and the carbonation level is right where it needs to be.","1137: Appearance: Pale golden pumpkin color with a 2 finger beige creamy head that looks like rocky whipped cream only not as bright white. Good head retention and lacing. Smell: Lots and lots of grapefruit from the hops. Extremely well done. Not overbearing but undeniably grapefruit rind goodness. Taste: Closer to a pale ale with a lot of grapefruit character. Not sure if its chinook hops or cascade that are being used here. Mouthfeel: A bit thin for my liking. Drinkability: Fairly easy to throw these 6.1 ABV cans back.","1150: A: Pours a cloudy orange with a crisp white two finger head layer. S: Slightly citrusy with a bit of hops here, too. T: Malty and hoppy, but neither overpowers. Very well balanced. M: Calm and balanced flavors. D: This would be a great beer for a hot summer day. Nothing wild, but simply a good beer.","1299: Amber with hints of orange with big tan foamy head with good retention and uneven lacing. Big citrus hop aroma. Big bitter grapefruit up frony with good caramel mellowing backbone. Smooth, silky feel with a low carb feel despite the big foamy head. A good overhopped IPA that's pleasant yet slightly one dimensional. Not worth $13.50\u002f6 pack unless you really need a good IPA in a can.","1321: Tap handle red \"Dry Hop Orange\" but alas, here we go. Warm hoppy sack of Mt. Hood on the nose. Citrus and Oranges rise up to the nearly caustic bitterness. Thinish mouthfeel, but damned drinkable. Amazing blend of malt and hop gives this a shockingly Orange Juice like flavor. I was convinced this was a fruit\u002fvegetable beer, and my notes end with \"blows ApriHop out of the water\". Hey, it was a long night of beer tasting ... still this was one tasty brew to quaff through the hot Portland summer night.","1386: Vintage 2010. A: Quarter finger light mocha fades to translucent of the same. Beer is dark, dark brown. No lacing to speak of. S: Extra roasty. Coffee, graham, cocoa, malt, licorice. I can say, however, the hops are still quite present. Piney, resiny. Malt dominant, but still hoppy. T: Roast, cocoa, coffee, lighter hops with earthy feel. Good beer. Not spending much time here, but this is really good. M: thick and syrupy. Like a good beer should be in this genre. D: this is a really good beer. I hate to be a slave to price point, but at nearly $13 for a bomber, I want to be wowed. The beer is good, really really good. If under $9\u002fbomber, I would be all about this one.","1454: Some discrepancy since the tap pull said Dry Hop Orange, but since nothing else shows on the site, I assume its the same thing.... Wonderfully rich copper color with drops of a rich red turning it darker. Nice foam cap clinging tightly with a pleasant yet assertive fresh citrus hop aroma. The taste is of similar richness. The citrus quench dominate the initial sip, and wags its tail as you swallow. A nice crisp malt body in the middle with enough richness to make it a red. Really, a very pleasing beer, perfect for the lupomaniac in your life.","1490: Drank 11\u002f5\u002f11 A: A slightly reddish amber hue, with a head that dissipates quickly and completely. Intriguing simply because it's a different color. S: It smells like an orange chocolate bar. Not what I was expecting at all, but I like it. Not the most exceptional or complex beer I've had, but it's good. T: Again, orange chocolate. Mmm mmm good. Very well balanced, and not a hint of booze. M: Good intermediate body, but nothing special. O: I enjoyed this beer, but I much prefer Caldera's other offerings.","1521: Reddish copper with pumpkin highlights and a dense cream and orange head of foam that leaves sticky lace on the glass. Citrusy and minty C-hops with plenty of caramely malt. It must be the can, the hop fresh flavors are off the charts with plenty of juicy grapefruit and orange backed with enough caramel malt to balance but still be hop forward. Medium bodied with prickly carbonation. A really nice session IPA.","1527: A golden orange and slightly fizzy brew with a slight fluffy off-white head that constricts slowly instead of outright fading away. A few minuscule dots of lace line the glass. A note of citrus hops is noticed on the nose at first, then a slight caramel sweetness follows up. Melon rind, a squirt of lemon on the tongue, some graininess in the background, and a drop of honey makes for a happy palate. Light to medium bodied with crisp edges. Cohesion is bliss.","1546: Deep dark orange in color with a one-finger tan head which lingers a second then drops away leaving a few small specks of lace. Sweet malts and oily hops rise pleasantly to the nose. Some subtle pine is mixed in. Tastes of bright fresh citrusy hops and the malt backbone does it's job evening things out well. Not as big on the hops as many other IPA's, but being that it comes in the can this one begs to be taken to the lake or to the beach as it has just enough taste to keep things interesting, and the fact that it's in a can is fookin' cool.","1623: A: Beer poured a light amber color with a orange hue and large 1\" off white head that lasted for sometime. Good lacing on the sides of the glass throughout consumption. S: Citrus, orange pith, pine, and some light caramel notes. T: As with the smell I get grapefruit, orange pith, lots of pine and some light caramel malt balance. This one is pretty hop dominate. M: Medium-light bodied, good carbonation with a drying finish. D: This beer is definately six pack worth and will be one of my camping beers from here on out.","1627: HOPS! If you like a hoppy beer, this is for you. Pours a golden brown with a nice foamy head. Complex flavors keep you interested with citrus and fruity notes. Just enough maltiness to keep the hops from being completely overwhelming. Aroma is strong with fruity citrus notes as well.","1679: Okay, pilseners aren't that hard to make, but being able to match what I drank in Germany? Well, that's a tall order. With that said, this reminded me of the beers I drank in Germany, when I favored the crisp, clean taste of a cold pilsener. The color is straw yellow and crystal-clear. The smell is light and floral, and the taste is crisp, malty-sweet and lightly hopped. In addition, the hops hit you then disappear. The mouthfeel is light, as a pilsener should be. Overall, an exceptional beer!","1682: poured into a tulip from a can with a two finger head and a deep copperish golden color with a slight reddish hue. smells like a slight twinge of alcohol and a floral yet citrusy hop aroma. and a sugary sweet malt backbone. Taste is bitterup front with a citrusy tongue with a sweet malt finish. relly quite impresive for my first craft beer from a can. super complex and tasty as hell. Mouth is suprisingly clean with a bite in the front. drinks moderately and really suprised me. For the cost I can't say it's worth it. 14.99 a six pack is steep for this one but it is a damn fine beer.","1709: Exceptionally pale yellow with vigorous carbonation, a light white head, fogged body, and full abstract lace. This simple session lager has a sustained head, a light appealing aroma, and enough Saaz to keep your feet tapping. Could use a catchier name though. Served on tap at the Siskiyou Pub, Ashland, OR.","1738: More of a 'dry' than a lager, tasted at the 2002 Oregon Brewers Festival. Orange color, orange flavor in nose. Light malts and fairly aggressively hopped; yet it is not very bitter. Interesting taste, complex and subtle. Light yet flavorful. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Nice beer. Would be a great beer to sip during a hot summer day.","1759: Standard lighter yellow pale ale here, good foamy head. Nice soft floral hop arrangement, if you like caldera, you'll be all good here. Plenty of taste in a pale, relative hefty amount of hops for style, light, ever so light toasting of the malt allows the hops to shine without making them exist in a ridiculous amount. Bitterness is sturdy, minty and metallic, but not a distraction or covering up the more delicate aspect of the beer, would say it leans to the grapefruit side of hop taste, cascade, chinook seem to be all over this one.","1765: 22 oz. bomber, A: Pours a pale yellow, soft white head, fairly good retention per the style. S: Some grainy malt notes, light hops, mild inoffensive nose. T: Direct pilsner esque barley malt flavour, light hopping. Again, mild but the malt flavour is good. M: Light-bodied, crisp, very clean, refreshing. D: A solid pale lager, not as much flavour as I wanted, maybe akin to Full Sail Session is what I was looking for. As an innocuous easy drinking lager it did its job.","1819: A friend of mine brought this beer for me from a trip to Oregon. It poured a hazy amber orange and produced a about one finger high, white bubbly head. It dissipates fast and leaves good lacing. The smell is very intense flowery hops, with a nice combination of orange, peach and citrus. The taste is just like the smell announced. Fruity citrus flavors up front, great hop character in the middle and a bittersweet finish, where some carefully measured orange balances a slight bitter end. Great beer and something I would love to try on tap.","1828: Eh. A little surprised at the rating here. Pours a copper, reddish orange. Definitely not the familiar yellowish, golden orange of most IPAs. Large off-white head. Smells faintly of pine, more strongly of ... well, citrus. Not quite grapefruit, just citrus-y. And there's maybe a whiff of malt. Well, maybe not. There's a strange toasted after-taste to the malt, and the hop flavoring is a touch muted. Really more like a pale ale than an ipa to me, though not quite that either. Some grapefruit, some random-y citrus notes, and a touch of sweet malt. Decent, but nothing to write home about.","1850: A: pours amber orange with a decent finger of off white head. S: grapefruit and light pine, and floral hop. There is some malt sweetness in the background. T: a nice tounge coating hop, that is piny, a citrus cross between grapefruit and orange. Malt is light but nicely sweet. M: coating hop, though the malt is light in the mouth, good carbonation. O: canned beer is really starting to grow on me, and leaves me impressed enough to try calderas other offerings","1859: Thanks to bman1113vr for sharing this bottle. The beer pours a clear brown color with a tan head. The aroma is heavy on the toffee and not too much else. The flavor is toffee, leather, tobacco, wood and dark fruit. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A decent beer but nothing too exciting.","1905: Clear dark amber with a good three finger white head. Plentiful lacings. Aroma is fruity citrus hops with a bit of leather. Taste is full deep leathery bitter hops with the correct amount of malts. The label describes \"centennial hops\" as the mainstay of all that bitterness. Mouthfeel is just right, and drinkability is very good for this style. Kudos to Caldera for daring to bottle a limited production beer. Their normal regimen is cans. Cool label. Give the fellows from the \"State of Jefferson\" a big thumbs up! Keep it coming Caldera!","410: Thanks to inflatablechair for sending out this great extra last month. Shared with a few others last saturday night. Poured a nice reddish brown color, with a bit of tan head on top. Aromas of toasted malt, caramel, orange zest and yeast. Medium bodied, with flavors of orange, caramel, toasted malt and yeast.","441: Thanks to fellow BA Roger for giving me this can the other night,poured into a standard pint glass a lighter pale golden with a thinner white head that left minmimal lace as it settled quickly.Fresh cascade hop aroams pine and leafy with a bit of firm biscuit malt,again fresh hoppy flavors quit citric and subdued pine with that firm lightly sweet biscuit\u002fcaramel base.An old school left coast pale here alot of hop flavor with a dose of lightly sweet malt,solid.","525: Pours a deep shade of gold with a fluffy ecru head. The aroma is biscuity, bolstered by grapefruit hops. The brew slides across the tongue, nice and oily. Malt and hops hold together in a nice balance, the hops always penetrating but never dominating. A tad sweeter than I'd like with a mild butter profile. This is a good, but not great, beer.","8: Pours a nice copper \u002f amber with a medium tan lasting head and nice lacing. Aroma of earthy piney hops, followed by some caramel malt and nice fruity bouquet. Taste is resiny earthy piney hops with some nice caramel maltiness and light fruity notes. Palate is nice crisp medium body with good carbonation. Finish is sweet caramel malt with some fruitiness ending with a good hoppy bitterness. Overall a seemed a bit on the hoppy side but seems to be well balanced, a good drinkable brew.","10: A: poured a caramel brown with a thin head that left a little bit of sticky lacing on the glass. S: at first I get caramel aromas with a underlying floral hop notes which had a good malt presence. There was also some citrus and bready notes as well. T: some nice piney hops pop out on the taste with caramel and citrus grapefruit accents that help out on the bitterness. It seems to have a decent malt backbone that helps out the balance. M: medium body with a low amount of carbonation that still works out but had a slight sweet and bitter hop finish. D: pretty good IPA that drank well and had a good amount of sweetness but lacked on the hop punch. It was still a tasty brew.","61: From the can at SAVOR 2011. Pours a clear golden color with an average white head and a slight amount of white lacing on the way down. The nose brings quite a bit of citrus hop character, mostly tending toward grapefruit. Quite nice. The flavor has just a touch of malt in the background and is instead focused on a fairly-heavy hop presence. Orange and grapefruit come through and perhaps a bit of a floral character. Medium body with good bitterness. Nice and dry. Solid brew.","67: Pours a reddish orange with a thick off-white head. Lots of sticky lacing, head reduces down to nice crust. Smells of pine, grapefruit, and resinous hops. Nice hoppy flavor with citrus and pine notes. I tinge of malt as well. Medium bodied mouth feel and overall a very drinkable beer.","82: From a can an aggressive pour into a chalice. Looks nice. Dark golden clear color with a decent head. Lace layers nicely on the side of the glass. Aroma is very pleasing building anticipation and expectations. The taste isn't quite there however. The citrus is there - to a fault. A little too bitter with an unpleasing aftertaste. It's good, just not quite ready for the big time. With all the great beers Oregon has to offer the competition is too tough to rate this beer among the best. If they smooth out the edges with a little balance this can be a great beer.","101: Can pours a clear gold with a sticky white head that laces the glass. Vibrant, leafy hop aromas are not overpowering but fresh and inviting, and are exceptionally well balanced on the palate by equally bold, complex malts. This is a very nice beer, one that I intend to buy again.","201: Great pale ale. Really sticks out among this blahh category. Very well balanced and refreshing. Nice hop aroma and taste but finish is well balanced. Hops and malt are just the right combo. Just what a pale ale is supposed to be. Very surprised by this brewery I'd never heard of.","210: Thanks to Flexabull to sending me this one out in the vet BIF. I like canned brews that are good and this one fit the bill. Can poured into a strain pint glass produced a nice amount of white head that settled to a lace. The body was clear golden amber in color This brew had plenty of floral hops aromas coming from the glass I could tell this was a west coat brew. The flavor was very hop forward too. I think it was extremely close to an IPA in my book, but I have noticed more and more of the APA's heading in that direction. It was crisp and light in the mouth. The brew was quite enjoyable to drink and I easily could have drank a six pack at a BBQ","266: Lovely orange-tan color, great lasting head, and plenty of lacing. A nice biscuit-malt aroma with crisp, fresh hops. Tastes like a great malty background with delectable hoppy bitter flavors dancing on your tongue. No shortage of pine or grapefruit either. Very balanced and flavorful. Easy to drink, with a good blend of ingredients producing a rich, smooth beer creation. Definitely a likable brew.","281: Received this can through Beer Powerball. I am really sorry that I don't know who sent it, my brother is keeping those records, but THANK YOU!! Pours with a nice half centimeter white fluffy head on a glass of dark straw-colored beer. Smells of citrusy hoppy goodness and oddly, a little like soap. Mouthfeel is very pleasant as is taste. This is a nice drinking beer. It's not blow you away with over-the-top flavor. It's a well-balanced, highly drinkable and enjoyable brew. I'm glad to have gotten the chance to try it.","282: Served from a can into a pint glass. Appears orange with a touch of gold. Foamy head present. Smell is underwhelming. Don't puck up too much on the hops front. Taste is good. There's sone hops with a tasty malt balance. Mouthfeel is creamy and full. Nice! Overall a pretty hoof experience. I'd have this again.","312: This bottle was hand delivered from my brother who lives in Portland, OR. The beers pours a deep burnt orange color with a small white head. Very nice lacing on the glass. The dominant smell is of sweet caramel. Taste is also sweet caramel with a strong earthly, almost dirty, hop finish that hangs! A decent beer, but much more malty than I would expect from a beer called Hopportunity Knocks.","483: Pours a very pale straw yello color with frothy white head, quickly dicipating but decent lacing. Smell is dominated by piney, earthy hops with a presence of citrus and floral. Pale straw like malts. Taste is a mirror of these scents, not much complexity, but good. Medium bodied, adequate carbonation. Definitely a refreshing, milder alternative to many pale ales currently out there.","512: What a classic pale ale, sent courtesy of unclejedi via the CEO BIF! And in a can, too! Poured a clear amber, mixed together with a golden hue. Sheets of white lace clung to the sides, excellent. Lite floral and citrus in the aroma, progressing into the taste which added pine and a squeeze of grapefruit. Sharp, crisp and dry this would be an excellent on the go brew for any outdoor activity. Hats off for this one!","616: Pours dark nice amberish color head. Smell is hoppy piney goodness Taste is hoppy (of course) I detected a tiny hint of citrus with followed by a nice grassy piney after taste. went down smooth and a wee bit creamy great beer to start the night out with. all and all typical Hopped out beer, but price VS quality one of the best out there.","661: Nice amber color with a great head and lacing, plus it's in a can! Love it when beers are in cans. It smells piney and earthy and gains in the taste. Earthy Munich malts balance with a lot of citrusy and herbal northwestern hops, with some metallic and peppery notes sneaking in to make a solid but not outstanding IPA. Slight stickiness to the mouthfeel, but very drinkable overall.","765: I didn't know what to expect from this brew when I ordered it up. I think the thing to keep in mind is this: if you are not a hop-head but love the flavor of the hop smell, this is the one for you! When I took the first sip, I realized that what this should have been called is \"hopjuice\". The taste is the supreme incarnation of Cascade hop aroma stripped off of the bitterness. I thought it was wonderful, although I knocked it down because the underlying beer characteristic did not push through as much as I would have liked. Being a NW interpretation of Red, however, the balance stood on its own very well. Terrific and recommended if you can get it.","778: 12 oz can poured into duvel snifter A - pours a deep amber, very lively, large white head that stays for a bit, very good looking beer S - huge citrus notes, absolutely amazing smelling beer T - amazing citrusy grapefruits and oranges amazing IPA, absolutely, the bitterness is perfectly balanced M - very smooth, creamy, easy to drink O - the best IPA I have ever had, absolutely amazing beer","780: Copper and light red pour, standard head to it. Dry hopping nose was there, but not huge, not super awesome or anything, just a bit of subtle vegetal hop quality to it with the peat malt thing. Citrus quality comes out on the tongue. Bitterness sustains itself throughout the entire beer. Pretty much an ordinary red spruced up with some green hops, and yes, it works. Makes the ordinary a little less ordinary. Doesn't skimp on the maltiness either. Dry finish for a red. Solid stuff, would drink again, and definitely recommend to someone who likes red ales. I am not fond of them, but enjoyed this.","832: Hazy apricot color with a solid frothy eggshell colored head with great retention and lacing. Visible carb at the edges. Nice floral and grapefruit hop notes on the nose. Good clean flavors. Nice mild hop notes up front with the same characteristics as the nose balanced well with the middle-backended caramel maltiness. Hops create a slightly bitter aftertaste. Mouth is crisp with a bit of a zip and high carb. Overall it's a good pale ale. A perfect beer to have in a can like it is, being a perfect beer to have while camping, golfing, fishing etc.","839: My first beer from this brew...and what a goodie! Over a finger of off-white head lingers over a translucent amber. The head lives a good amount of sticky lacing all over the glass. Aromas of floral and herbal hops with a sweet but bready maltiness as a distance backbone. Earthy notes in both the aroma and taste. Tons of bitter residuals linger on the palate, thanks in part to a medium mouthfeel. This is a delicious IPA, and I look forward to grabbing more cans from this brewery!","876: Thanks to rayjay for the extra in a trade. Pours a slightly hazy orange with a nice, tight white head that laces like glue. Smells of massive amounts of hops, damn near all of them. Lots of citrus and pine, with some caramel malt as well. Tastes wonderfully hoppy, tons of pine and citrus yet an almost grainy note, also slightly vegetal. There is a lot of malt here to back things up, there's a nice tight carbonation and it feels dense. Very easy to drink on after an evening of flying frizbee.","883: Snagged a can of this after seeing that it's got such a positive amount of reviews. The beer poured out as a clear yellowish gold color, it has a pretty good looking soapy head on it. The lacing is a little sticky but not too much. The smell of the beer has a really nice malty and hoppy aroma. The hops smell bright and fruity. The taste of the beer was pretty good. The hops were definitely in there ready to hit ya in the mouth. The malt cleaned up the mess in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was light and refreshing. Overall it was a pretty good IPA.","901: Pours a nice golden peach color with a frothy long lasting ivory head. Smells of earthy grassy hops and a little citrus. Great tasting with plenty of bitterness and some grapefruit. Just enough of a malt backbone to let those grassy hops shine. A medium-bodied and flavorful IPA available in a can that reminded me of a nicer version of 60 min. If the price point were lower, I'd drink this a ton.","981: 22oz bottle into snifter. 2011 vintage. from notes. Pours black with a thick mocha colored head that dissipates fairly quickly. The aroma is of cocoa, with roasty malts. I can just barely pick up notes of the licorice. The taste follows the nose fairly well. Cocoa mixed with astringent coffee, though the licorice is more pronounced then in the aroma. The mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied with subtle carbonation. This was quite drinkable, and left me a very good impression of the brewery.","1004: A - Poured a copper color with a big off white head that leaves a ton of lacing behind S - Is a nose full of hops that are both citrus and piney with a touch of caramel malt kicking around T - Follows the nose hops upfront more pine than citrus with the caramel malt trying to come through to add some balance M - This beer has a medium body with higher carbonation to it D - I'm enjoying this IPA quite a bit I don't know if it coming from a can is making me like it more but this beer tastes good and is worth a try if you see it around","1009: Pours a clear gold color, with a big impressive white head. Nice hoppy cascade nose. Floral, and pine like. Beer has a pretty light quality. But is still tasty. Light crisp hop flavor, a bit of malty sweetness and creaminess, and a slightly piney and resiny hop finish. Nice simple APA. Mouthfeel is pretty good. As mentioned, it's a bit light, but still feels nice in the mouth. Drinkability is very good. Light and easy drinking, yet still a tasty APA. Session worthy. I love canned craft beer!","1021: Wonderful fluffy full headed porter. Great esspresso aromas, roasted coffee. Salty under taste..this is minor yet sets the theme for the porter..the saltiness makes you gulp more of the chocolaty ,.coffee goodness. Great drinking beer..with great backing.","1031: Tapped this open and a fruity piney smell, Cloudy golden orange color when poured in a pint glass. Nice foaming thick head. Big and hoppy, yet smooth as butter. Minimal hop after taste (I like this, so was a liittle disappointed with the lack there of there) However, a delicious beer. Would drink it anytime!! I bet on draft it is a delight!","1051: A: gold yellow\u002flight orange bubbly\u002fshiny body, finger white fluffy head, fantastic lacing S: grapefruit, pine, lemon peel T: grapefruit, lemon, earthy malt, piny oily\u002fsticky bitter finish M: med\u002flight, light oily\u002fsticky mouth O: Yummy, easy going APA. Great session brew, highly recommend, will buy again. Thrilled to see another extremely tasty, lighter American craft brew. Going to become a regular in my frig! VERY GOOD, TREAT YOURSELF!","1064: Poured into tulip glass. Appearance: Deep mahogany with red hue, pours 1 finger of off-white head that fades quickly. Lots of lacing. Smell: Roasted malt, chocolate, orange zest, slightly boozy as it warms, raw sugars. Taste: roasted malt, chocolate, blood orange, sweet, brown sugar. Mouthfeel: full bodied, good carbonation. Overall: A tasty porter. I like the subtle blood orange element. Not a lot going on here, but what there is is quite good. Drinkability is above average.","1073: Thanks to 5000 for sending this can my way. The beer pours a dark amber color with a white head. Darker than expected. The aroma is very nice. I get a lot of grapefruit and pine notes. The flavor is similar. The predominant flavor is some resiny pine from the hops but I also get some grapefruit. The toffee and caramel malt backbone balance out the beer nicely and keep the bitterness level fairly low for a west coast IPA. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very nice.","1096: Clear golden-orange color with small white head that laces well. Slightly sweet and spicy toasty grain with some floral and slightly woodsy and fruity hops. Lightly toasted and sweet fruity pale malts perfectly balanced by orangey citrus and floral hop bitterness that's a bit persistent. Nice light-moderate body that feels even easier due to the high, but no too stingy carbonation. Extremely drinkable Pale that I would definitely buy again.","1134: Pours a mahogany color, rich, with a tan head. a finger, didn't stick around. Holy smokes! This is one of the most smokiest beer I've ever had! BUT. It's balance and not one sided. Smoke, cured bacon, rich caramel malts. More smoke. Ok, maybe it one sided, but it's heavenly. Rich caramel malts and salty cured bacon strips. Bacon lover right here, so, I don't feel the need to go on. Lighter, but medium in body. feels fine. Nothing tremendous. Aroma and flavor alone are mouthwatering. Bravo. More please!!!","1136: A- Pours a nice amber color with a whit head. S- Hops with a citrus tone hint of malt. T- Hops and citrus tones with a hint of a malt finish. M- Semi dry with hop flavors through out sip and a malt finish. D- Pretty good beer from Oregon. I can drink this again with no worries. Cheers...","1137: Appearance: Pale golden pumpkin color with a 2 finger beige creamy head that looks like rocky whipped cream only not as bright white. Good head retention and lacing. Smell: Lots and lots of grapefruit from the hops. Extremely well done. Not overbearing but undeniably grapefruit rind goodness. Taste: Closer to a pale ale with a lot of grapefruit character. Not sure if its chinook hops or cascade that are being used here. Mouthfeel: A bit thin for my liking. Drinkability: Fairly easy to throw these 6.1 ABV cans back.","1150: A: Pours a cloudy orange with a crisp white two finger head layer. S: Slightly citrusy with a bit of hops here, too. T: Malty and hoppy, but neither overpowers. Very well balanced. M: Calm and balanced flavors. D: This would be a great beer for a hot summer day. Nothing wild, but simply a good beer.","1179: Pours a clear very light yellow with strong carbonation but a weak head. The aroma is sweet, non-descript malt with just a touch of grassy hops and some graininess. The flavor is quite similar with pale malt sweetness, some grassy herbal hops, clean yeast, grainy notes and a surprising amount of bitterness. I have to say that the flavor is pretty disappointing, even for this style, though the dryness does give it some merit. Mouthfeel is not just light, but watery. It has a nice dry finish and is very quaffable, and holds up alright when compared to other beers in this category, but I think there are better options.","1255: A - pours a clear orangish rust color with a half inch of sticky white foam S - nice citrus hop aroma of lemon and grapefruit and bready malts T - bready malt backbone with some nice citrus hops and a good hoppy bite in the finish M\u002fD - light bodied with lots of flavor, crisp mouthfeel, i'm definitely going to have more of this one","1277: Overall a really nice and interesting beer. I saw this on the shelf and hadn't tried anything yet from this brewery but looked interesting. Figured I would try it. It was really a nice beer. It definitely had a lot of smoky and meaty flavor to it! Very interesting and nice beer overall, I would drink it again.","1314: Red mahagonny. Yellow tinted head, thick full and dense, holds itself with stern authority. Sticky lacing also. Great hop aroma. Thick citrus fruit with berry components. A bready sweet malt really mends well with the abundance of fruit. Impeccably balanced. Nothing out of the ordinary necessarily but one of those brews that is just dead on. Bitter finish with fruit driven mid palate and a toffee core, all intertwined with dried berry puree. Nice and thick and drinkable.","1331: 12oz can poured into a pint Pours a hazy golden color with a fluffy white head. Some nice staying power and spider web lacing. The aroma is musty and earthy with layers of pine and orange. On the palate, this guy is a little more pine and citrus forward while the earthy, musty hops come through in the middle. The finish is earthy bitter with a touch of pine resin. Light medium body with good carbonation. This is a nice pale ale that deserves a spot in any rotation. Borderline sessionable.","1347: 12oz can. A) Pours with a tight, creamy head. Takes a bit to settle. Hazy body, amber in color. Sticky lacing. S) Piney. Grapefruit. Caramel. T) Well balanced flavor combination. Caramel. Orange. Starts a little bit bitter then moves right into the malty sweetness. Finishes with a hop bit and subtle spruce and alcohol. M) Crisp up front then smooths out. Medium body. D) A well crafted brew. I'd definitely drink another one.","1403: Poured from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass, the beer has a deep red-copper color with a small, thin 1\u002f2\" head that dissipates quickly. The beer is heavily smelling of hops and floral, with a little bit of a smokey background. The hops flavor hits the middle of the tongue, and there is a very short lasting, bitter undertone to it. There is a bitter and at the same time sour aftertaste to the finish, and the bitter portion of that will linger from some time after the beer is gone. It's a heavy IPA that is full of flavor in mouth, but the lingering aftertaste makes this a \"one and done\" for me. I thoroughly enjoy this beer, but one bomber at a time.","1433: Picked up a 6-pack at State Line in Maryland. Poured a golden amber with a good white head. This beer reminds me of Dale's Pale Ale, and not because of the can. There's a big punch of citrus and pine hops that's met (more so here than with Dale's) by a hit of caramel malt. Very drinkable and a tasty, more balanced IPA.","1490: Drank 11\u002f5\u002f11 A: A slightly reddish amber hue, with a head that dissipates quickly and completely. Intriguing simply because it's a different color. S: It smells like an orange chocolate bar. Not what I was expecting at all, but I like it. Not the most exceptional or complex beer I've had, but it's good. T: Again, orange chocolate. Mmm mmm good. Very well balanced, and not a hint of booze. M: Good intermediate body, but nothing special. O: I enjoyed this beer, but I much prefer Caldera's other offerings.","1585: I got this one as an extra from one of those awesome West Coast BAs! Thanks! This one pours a nice golden color with an off-whie head. Nice lacing that lasts. Upon popping the top I was hit immediately by a cascate of hoppy smells coming from the can. Smells delicious with the malt to balance things nicely. The taste follows the nose with a nice, crisp finish. In the mouth this one is nice and creamy. This is a highly drinkable beer. It has a nice hoppy dry finish that keeps your mouth wanting more.","1589: Pours a deep gold with a 2 finger head that dissipates to a fine layer, leaving lots of sticky lacing on the glass. Floral hoppy aromas, salty biscuits, and a whiff of ginger. Malty biscuit flavor, then a strong taste of bitter greens\u002fgreen pepper, with a lingering grapefruit finish. Hops are a bit numbing on the tongue. Body is light and the carbonation is enough to give this a moderately creamy mouthfeel. Eminently drinkable beer, for those who like their IPAs with a bitter green hop taste.","1593: The beer pours a nice yellow-orange, with a thick white head. Looks delish. Maybe its my nose, but I don't detect too much - citrusy hops with a pine undergirding. But the taste is exceptional. Wonderfully bright hops and a satisfying malt backbone. But like most west coast ipas, this is not balanced...thankfully. A hops explosion of grapefruit, spice, and pine. Awesome. This is the best IPA i've had in a can...and one of the better ones around PERIOD. Check this one out.","1626: Pours a crisp clear pale gold color with a small head that dissipates rather quickly. Has a bitter hoppy pine and citrus smell. Very pungent for a APA. Bitter bite hits right away and fades to a smooth caramel malty biscuity flavor. Not very complex, but good tastes none the less. A very light smooth beer. Very sessionable could def hammer a few of these back.","1627: HOPS! If you like a hoppy beer, this is for you. Pours a golden brown with a nice foamy head. Complex flavors keep you interested with citrus and fruity notes. Just enough maltiness to keep the hops from being completely overwhelming. Aroma is strong with fruity citrus notes as well.","1649: A: Poured a hazy amber color with a nice white cap S: Faded piney hops, caramel T: Caramel and faded hops battle for dominance while the metallic and old Earthy notes fight for second place. Bad. M: Medium to full body and not one I would recommend hiolding on your palate O: Poor IPA, drainpoured after two sips","1658: First micro brew for me in a can. Cool logo but with no freshness date. It pours a amber color with a nice sea foam head. The smell is strong of hops. The taste hits you with a dry hop appeal with a huge hop profile. It leaves a stinging pleasant aftertaste as it journeys down the throat. I really like the uniqueness of the this American IPA profile.","1682: poured into a tulip from a can with a two finger head and a deep copperish golden color with a slight reddish hue. smells like a slight twinge of alcohol and a floral yet citrusy hop aroma. and a sugary sweet malt backbone. Taste is bitterup front with a citrusy tongue with a sweet malt finish. relly quite impresive for my first craft beer from a can. super complex and tasty as hell. Mouth is suprisingly clean with a bite in the front. drinks moderately and really suprised me. For the cost I can't say it's worth it. 14.99 a six pack is steep for this one but it is a damn fine beer.","1693: 12oz can courtesy of Reino poured into a pint glass. Pours a clear light golden with a decent creamy white head that hung on as a cap for a while leaving good lacing. The aroma is very light with lots of lemony hops up front and a bit of bready malts as well. The flavor had the light citrus up front with the malts in the middle before giving way to some faint pine hop bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated and lighter than most pale ales. This is a very drinkable pale that doesn't have too much differentiation but is still tasty.","1697: appearance - light amber color, just a little darker than I expected from the nose, big frothy head. Smell - very nice hop, pine, some fruit taste - nice hoppy grapefruite taste, dry finish mouthfeel - very even, not too thin, not too chewy for a single ipa overall - solid, I doubt I will pay $12.99 again for this brew and it probably factored into my rating","1709: Exceptionally pale yellow with vigorous carbonation, a light white head, fogged body, and full abstract lace. This simple session lager has a sustained head, a light appealing aroma, and enough Saaz to keep your feet tapping. Could use a catchier name though. Served on tap at the Siskiyou Pub, Ashland, OR.","1730: Interesting beer...not too sure how I feel about this. Looks good enough...cloudy orange with a decent white head. Malty, very floral smell. Creamy, light caramel scent. Light hops. Weird, floraly hop taste. Sour-ish after taste. Weird, bready character. Definitely can taste the rose, but its all muddled. Nothing really stands out. Slightly flat, not horrible. I think this would be better as a pint or a six pack, not a bomber.","1736: Delicious full bodied stout with all the trimmings. Leather, wood, tobacco, sugary fruit. The nice thing about Old Growth is that you can savor the \"mature\" end of the taste spectrum without having to be knocked out by a 12%+ abv. Caldera's move into the richer end of the spectrum is exciting, looking forward to their future beers ! This beer is a great seasonal, not trying to dethrone abyss, but a great addition to the fall\u002fwinter lineup.","1752: Golden amber body with a solid finger of thick white head. Rather light for a Pale. Nose is light hops, grassy but tart. Flavor is lightly sweet, a moderate foundation of malt that balances the hops. Wonderful hops, tart C hops, but not overdone. A well balanced brew that is flavorful, yet still very quenching. Mouthfeel is tart and tangy. Drinkability is great! A very tasty and easily drinkable Pale. Bring me more!","1753: Pours out a pale straw like color with a bubbly 2 finger deep white head. Smells of light flowery Cascade hoppiness, pine, spruce, tropical. Flavor is soft bisquity maltiness, piney hops, faint caramel sweetness, earthy tone, nicely balanced. Crisp, clean, light to medium bodied, lingering bitterness. Highly drinkable. excellent summer session brew. Should be a campsite\u002fcooler standard.","1759: Standard lighter yellow pale ale here, good foamy head. Nice soft floral hop arrangement, if you like caldera, you'll be all good here. Plenty of taste in a pale, relative hefty amount of hops for style, light, ever so light toasting of the malt allows the hops to shine without making them exist in a ridiculous amount. Bitterness is sturdy, minty and metallic, but not a distraction or covering up the more delicate aspect of the beer, would say it leans to the grapefruit side of hop taste, cascade, chinook seem to be all over this one.","1764: Poured a deep copper hue with a one and a half finger foamy white head. There was good retention and lacing. The smell featured a full cereal grain, caramel and a citric hop. The taste was mainly hop driven with a grain full malt behind. Citus and pine dominated. Theouthfeel was typical of the style with a very dry finish. Overall a tasty hop driven west coast ale.","1789: Poured from a can into a a Chouffe Flute A-Very deep nice amber\u002fdark copper laces thick and sticky down the glass, very sexy looking in the glass. S-very floral bitter hop smell. Grapefruit notes very citrusy. T-Much like the nose great bitterness in the front middle and back. Has a nice sweet malt quality in the middle, almost like a sweeter orange flavor very subtle but adds alot. M-Medium body near perfect on the carbonation. D-Only reason this is not a 5 is the price everything else about this beer on this section is flawless.","1816: This has recently hit the NC market...in reading reviews I' puzzled at the reviews. This is an AWESOME IPA...simply awesome. Appearance is great, cloudy with a very decent 2\" head. Smell is fresh hops and malt...more hops than malt. Taste is mostly all grapefruit hops...I love it. Right next to G'Night (Gordon) as the best beer from a can...I gave my son a can and even his collage buddies who don't like IPA's said it was amazing. The price point is a little high ($13 for a sixer) in NC but I love this brew.","1825: Review is from notes. Picked this up while visiting family in pennsylvania. A: Dark yellow, good head, great pour S: Hops, sugar, some floral T: Bitter up front, malt balances nicely M: A bit bubbbly for my taste. Needs a little less carbonation D: Ok. Not the best pale ale but decent.","1871: Poured from the can a clear golden hue with two fingers of bright white head. Good lacing all around. Aroma is slightly sour and malty much like a pilsner. A slight whiff of sulfur and vegetables as well. The taste has a bitter edge along with malt and biscuit. Lighter bodied, dry, and moderately carbonated. Pretty drinkable, but this is a fairly decent pale ale that sits in the middle of the pack.","1893: Smell is light, almost non-existent, must be trapped in the dark amber. Very light head tops a thin effervescent surface. Taste is belgian yet bitter, with very little of the promised oranges. I'm getting a lot of roast out of this, which normally would be a compliment but it just doesn't fit what I was expecting. Aside from the bitter notes the beer is pretty good, it's almost like a belgian strong dark coffee stout ale.","1905: Clear dark amber with a good three finger white head. Plentiful lacings. Aroma is fruity citrus hops with a bit of leather. Taste is full deep leathery bitter hops with the correct amount of malts. The label describes \"centennial hops\" as the mainstay of all that bitterness. Mouthfeel is just right, and drinkability is very good for this style. Kudos to Caldera for daring to bottle a limited production beer. Their normal regimen is cans. Cool label. Give the fellows from the \"State of Jefferson\" a big thumbs up! Keep it coming Caldera!","1907: Poured into an imperial nonic a clear copper with a great one finger sticky white head that nver really leaves,a frothy mass is there during the whole duration of the glass.Big caramel malt in the nose with subdued citric hops,a little hop oomph and it would be great.Citric and herbal hops play against a big caramel\u002fbiscuit malt base with neither getting the upper heand really.There is a little lightly roasted nuttiness in the malt profile as well.A beer thats oh so close to being stellar,just bump up the hop profile and there you go,as is its pretty good.","1919: Appearance - Pours a pale golden color with about a finger of quickly dissipating head that leaves little lacing on the edges of the glass. Smell - Light hops, grainy malts, breadyness. Taste - Taste is similar to the nose with a hint of caramel\u002fhoney. Nothing really stands out to me as special, but then again what do you expect with the description on the side of this. Mouthfeel - Light bodied, prickly carbonation. Drinkability - Quite drinkable to be honest, however as someone else stated, might as well buy some PBR's rather than spend money on this.","636: this is my first Caldera brew have seen cans of pale ale and ipa before. Upon pouring this ipa i saw a hazy amber beer with a thick dull white head and smelled hops. A goodstart to an ipa. The smell is of citrus-grapefruit, earthy, and a hint of pine. The taste is pungent grapefruit, battling pine, and subtle sweet malt flavor. Not the most complex beer but all the same good.","6: Service Temperature, 40 degrees. Service Glassware, 8 ounce ikea globe. Appearance, is copper orange & hazy with a strong white foamy head, which recedes revealing a curtain of lace behind. Aroma, is noticable with citrus hops with some green 'earth-like' notes, and a waft of minor malt finish. To the tongue an orange citrus with a pine finish and some earthy tones, with a nice malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is mild to medium. Overall a nice welcome to the scene at least for a newbie to Caldera such as myself. Cheers","39: A can picked up in Baltimore. Pours a clear amber color with lots of foamy off-white head. Good retention leaves some spotty lacing. Smells of grassy hops, bread, caramel, and earth. Tastes of bread, toasted grains, caramel, lite citrus, and an earthy and grassy finish. Medium in body with good carbonation. Clean and smooth, malty and grainy with a nice bitter finish. Refreshing and easy to drink, a nice canned amber ale that I would definitely enjoy while out and about in the Summer time.","43: Had this on 2011-09-23 in Lynchburg, VA A - Almost clear, orange-amber with a 2-finger off-white head with big bubbles and moderate lacing. S - Fairly strong aroma that can be smelled 18\" away. Sweet malt, citrus and hop floral. T - Much like the aroma. Sweet bread and fruit followed by a dash of orange flesh a touch of spice and finally orange rind bitterness doesn't dominate. A pleasant, well-balanced bitter-sweet taste although it doesn't blow my hair back. M - Medium body and carbonation. A bit syrupy with some prickle O - I enjoyed this brew. It has a lot of flavor for being 6.1% ABV.","75: Caldera IPA pours a slightly hazy golden-amber with half-inch thick, foamy head that is not going anywhere. It has the most serious lacing I've witnessed and my pint glass is coated up to the top. Smell is a grassy and citrus burst, lemons. The taste is very smooth up front with a bite at the end. It has that grapefruit sourness; a nice blend of hops and subtle malts. Slight carbonation and a very easy mouthfeel for this IPA, not heavy at all. This brew should be a top contender in the IPA market if it is not already and it is one of my favorites ever since it was recommended to me. Shout outs to Whole Foods Plymouth Meeting.","80: 12oz can picked up at Brewforia on the way home tonight... paid $1.89... poured into my Delirium goblet. 1\" white head drops leaving descent lacing... the brew is pretty clear golden... Nose is lite pine and a bit more citrus hops... pale malts... ehhh.. okay. Flavor mirrors the nose with some biscuity maltiness.. body and carbonation are both where they should be. Overall.. this is descent pale ale.. but I doubt I'll pick it up again unless I was going camping or hot springing.. 4\u002f3.5\u002f3\u002f3.5\u002f4","103: Pours a dark amber with a moderate head. Smell is pretty nice! Pine and tropical fruits. Taste starts with a nice blend of bitter pine and fruit punch, without being overly sweet. Pretty dry finish, medium-light mouth. This is a nice little surprise and drinkable but not complex enough to be interesting beyond one. But overall for what it is, Caldera has a winner.","127: Had this on tap at the recently opened Hawthorne Hophouse. Hadn't been there before. I'll review it soon. They served this one in a 12oz. tulip. A: This beer has a dark brown reddish look that had a pretty tan looking head. S: It smells quite intense. A resin malty scent that carries with it some alcohol. T: This beer tastes like resiny caramel. It is a little sweet and has a long drawn out flavor. M: It dries out your mouth with the lingering dry aftershock. Not a very carbonated beer. Quite a bit of body for even this color. D: I could have a few of these. Definately an intense strong ale, but I'll admit I'm a sucker for Caldera.","242: Big thanks to G311 for this one. A - Nice big IPA appearance: deep amber with a rich head, though lesser retention and lace. S - Really a very muted nose. It is nearly astoundingly so. T - The taste is quite a bit more, well, existent... because there is really nothing but a ghost of and IPA there in the aroma dept. A bit floral and grassy, and some caramel; tastes good, just not exceptional. M - IPA. A little flaccid. D - Doesn't measure up to the Red Racer IPA that preceded it (not that it was world-class, either). Probably not even as good as the regular Caldera IPA.","247: The Caldera Pale Ale poured an clear orange hue with a finger foam head. It had some tight bubble lacing patterns. The aroma was semi sweet malty smell with some pine hopiness jumping into the nose. It had a powerful aroma for a pale ale. Taste was good. It has a bread malt up front with a moderate hop feel on the back end. In the mouth it had a good sharp bite on the finish. Overall a good solid local pale ale.","255: Awsome yellow can caught my eye. Bought at the Sacramento Co-op which is behind my house. a: I drank the first two out of the can. For some reason I really like drinking out of a can. Pours a nices light brown color in to a pint glass. Has a full head. s: Leans on the bisquity side. I'm feeling Nectar IPA here. Good, dirty, malty nose taste: Really nice bend of malts and hops here. Again can't help but think of nectar IPA, one of my favorites. This beer hits the spot with that wonderful mix of malt and hop flavors. m and d: The drinkablity is great due to the light mouth feel on this beer.","483: Pours a very pale straw yello color with frothy white head, quickly dicipating but decent lacing. Smell is dominated by piney, earthy hops with a presence of citrus and floral. Pale straw like malts. Taste is a mirror of these scents, not much complexity, but good. Medium bodied, adequate carbonation. Definitely a refreshing, milder alternative to many pale ales currently out there.","505: I had this very nice IPA on-tap at Brewer's Haven in Boise, Idaho after I had completed a little beer shopping. Poured amber with a nice head and great lacing. Smells very fruity with candied orange peel and grapefruit pith. The taste is very full, with bitter hops, breadiness. Sharp pine and earth in the hop profile. A little chewy in the mouth, but ovarall this is dry, bitter, and delicious.","526: 355ml can poured into a Young's pint pot. A. Copper coloured clear ale with a foamy white head. Head retention was brilliant. S. Buttery, slightly musty, some fruit - perhaps melon and some orange T. Malty, hoppy. A faint touch of scotch in the maltiness. M. Medium bodied, oily. D. Another thumbs up to my third canned beer from this brewery but considering that I 'go' for higher ABV beers I would have to rank this as my least favourite of the three Caldera beers I have had but still would not refuse another one.","558: Thanks to Kegatron for hooking me up with a can. Pours a clear amber color with 3 fingers of tall foamy off-white head. Great retention leaves lots of lacing stick. Smells of caramel, pine, grapefruit, and spicy hops. Tastes of toasted grains, caramel, citrus fruits, and bitter spicy and earthy hops in the finish. Medium in body with good carbonation. Crisp and balanced with a nice woodsy bitter finish. Easy to drink and enjoyable. A solid sessionable IPA that has me looking forward to trying more stuff from Caldera.","560: Caldera Brewing Company--Caldera Pale Ale--2009 12 oz. Micro Can. 5.60% ABV. 55 IBU's. (4.0 \u002f 5.0) Foamy thin mild lace white head. Clear bright thin yellow orange gold color. Sediment dusty end to pour. Rich aromatic floral hop fruit ester front.

Sampled 7\u002f25\u002f2010. 3 Cans. 6-Pack $10.99.","594: Thanks to flexabull for this in the UGLY BIF. Gotta love craft canned beers. Pours a pale yellow color, slight opaqueness, good sized head with a little retention layer and a little bit of lacing. Smell is stronger than I would expect from a pale ale, strong citrus and grapefruit aroma with hops, makes me think it could almost be an IPA if some more hops were added. Taste hits with the hops and citrus first, leaves an interesting bitterness in the mouth, not quite good but not quite bad, carbonation is just right and it goes down crisp and smooth, I could see this being an easily sessionable brew if it was available in Maine.","608: Poured into pint glass. A - reminiscent of a pilsner more than an APA, 2 fingers of white head, head lasted a while, just kinda floated there S - light hints of citrus, mostly grapefruit and lemon, maybe a little bready T - hop blast, pretty bitter and dry, follows the smell closely M - good carbonation, good body for the style, not too light and certainly not heavy D - great for a canned beer, cant beat the portability and taste, just started to get the caldera brews in my local beer store, will continue to try new ones","660: Can from Beerzack. Thanks! Pours Semi-clear reddish amber witha big lasting chunky whitish head that leaves lots of lacing. Smell is sweet fruity, fresh and hoppy. Very nice. Taste is smooth with fruity caramel and fresh citrusy, and sweet orange flavored hops and bitter citrus rind. Nice and strongly bittered which lasts in the finish but with a light lingering sweetness too. Very good IPA.","661: Nice amber color with a great head and lacing, plus it's in a can! Love it when beers are in cans. It smells piney and earthy and gains in the taste. Earthy Munich malts balance with a lot of citrusy and herbal northwestern hops, with some metallic and peppery notes sneaking in to make a solid but not outstanding IPA. Slight stickiness to the mouthfeel, but very drinkable overall.","683: No Canned on Date A - Pours a rich amber color. Completely clear, with minimal head. S - Sweet hoppy syrupy smells. Hints of piney resin. T - Piney, resin, floral hops. No noticeable citrus qualities. Finishes very dry and bitter. M - Medium body with moderate to high carbonation. Just right for an IPA. D - Nothing I would go out of my to get again, but nothing I'd turn down either. This is a solid IPA. Not a lot to rant about, both positive and negative. The flavors are pretty one dimensional, bitter piney hops, no citrus undertones that I enjoy so much.","690: Can recieved in a recent trade as en extra. A: Decent head, takes a minute or so to settle down. Very clear light orange colored beer. Some lacing. S: Fruity scents with not too much hops present in the nose. T: This beer just is not a solid example of the style. Really not much of a hop presence at all. With what I have heard about Caldera 'Old Growth' I was hoping this would be a pleasant surprise. I'd skip this one if I was looking for a solid IPA M: Low to medium carbonation. Slightly oily mouthfeel. O: Move along, nothing to see here.","694: Drank on tap at Old Town Pizza in Portland in pint glass. A: Solid amber hue; lacing in glass. S: Slightly grass smell, hoppy notes on the nose. T & M: This was a quite hoppy pale ale but not overly so, this is a nicely done pale ale. D: Highly drinkable, this is a pale ale that could definitely be sessionable. I really enjoyed this beer but get a feeling that I'll have a hard time finding this in Dallas.","777: Poured from the can a slightly-hazed amber gold with a huge frothy off-white head. Juicy aroma of grapefruit and pine hops and sweet, bready malts. Hoppy bitterness upfront with the grapefruit and pine. Sweet malts and caramel offer a good balance. Lighter bodied, crisp and dry, with a moderate carbonation. A super sessionable and flavorful IPA from Caldera. A bit steep at $12 a sixer, but then again, I'd much rather have one of these outdoors than most other options.","839: My first beer from this brew...and what a goodie! Over a finger of off-white head lingers over a translucent amber. The head lives a good amount of sticky lacing all over the glass. Aromas of floral and herbal hops with a sweet but bready maltiness as a distance backbone. Earthy notes in both the aroma and taste. Tons of bitter residuals linger on the palate, thanks in part to a medium mouthfeel. This is a delicious IPA, and I look forward to grabbing more cans from this brewery!","891: A - pours an amber color with a two finder head that is retained for a good 5-10 minutes. The beer is almost as clear as a lager...not cloudy at all. S - very strong citrus smells. T - similar to the smells, the first predominant taste is citrusy. After that, you get a hint of caramel. Then the hops come through and leave a nice bitterness finish. D - I love this IPA. It's one of my favorites! It's exactly how a west coast IPA should taste. The only issue could be a slight lack in carbonation.... But I find that true of most craft can beer I try.","911: My main man woodychandler comes through with yet another canned beer for me to try. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a orange\u002fbrownish color with a 1\u002f2 inch head. Smell is very hoppy, not much else. Taste is also all hops, dry and bitter, not much else coming through. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer.","976: 12 oz. can with a slightly different look from the one shown above. No freshness date Poured a bright, clear orange with a half-inch white head. Very subdued fruity aromas which quickly fade. This is the least impressive character of this ale. The ale begins with a pleasant bitterness that lingers on the tongue. There is a very faint metallic flavor that quickly faded. Overall, this is dry and refreshing. Noticeably carbonated with a light body. The mouthfeel is clean and refreshing. While not very complex, this is a summer quaffer with its light, refreshing body and slight fruity bitterness.","1004: A - Poured a copper color with a big off white head that leaves a ton of lacing behind S - Is a nose full of hops that are both citrus and piney with a touch of caramel malt kicking around T - Follows the nose hops upfront more pine than citrus with the caramel malt trying to come through to add some balance M - This beer has a medium body with higher carbonation to it D - I'm enjoying this IPA quite a bit I don't know if it coming from a can is making me like it more but this beer tastes good and is worth a try if you see it around","1028: Picked up a can at Abe's Cold Beer for a couple bucks and drank it with a Thai curry (good combo). At first seems like a simple, but tasty pale ale. The malts provide a little toast and caramel, while the hops pull in the usual citrus notes. As it warms and I think about what I'm tasting and smelling, a lot more comes out. There are hints of pineapple in the hops, hard sugar candy in the aroma, and peppery spice compliments the orange rind aftertaste. Check this beer out and make sure you let it warm up.","1072: Can from K&L Redwood City. A - Pours a bright medium amber color with a two-finger, lasting off-white head and good lacing. S - Aroma is piney and citrusy hops, a touch of sweet malt, and tropical fruits. T - Flavor is a little pale and caramel malt, but mostly showcases a complex hop profile, with pine, pineapple, orange, and grapefruit. Pretty harshly bitter, although I like that of course. M - Crisp palate with medium body and carbonation. D - Solid. Overall this is the best canned IPA I've had after Surly Furious.","1073: Thanks to 5000 for sending this can my way. The beer pours a dark amber color with a white head. Darker than expected. The aroma is very nice. I get a lot of grapefruit and pine notes. The flavor is similar. The predominant flavor is some resiny pine from the hops but I also get some grapefruit. The toffee and caramel malt backbone balance out the beer nicely and keep the bitterness level fairly low for a west coast IPA. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very nice.","1201: What's this? Caldera brew in a bottle! Who knew?! I thought they were strictly about the can, but I stand corrected. The pour is a nice copper color with a thin layer of head that vanishes quickly, and the lacing is minimal. Citrus hops along side mild malts on the nose. Mouthfeel is medium with a nice amount of carb. The flavor is good and hoppy; nice and bitter! This is not a beginner's ale, so if you are new to the micro game, this may not be the beer for you. Since this is a Caldera brew, it could EASILY pass for an IPA. Overall drinkability is great. I really like this and could easily sit down with a few of these on a weekend with friends and a barbeque.","1237: My thirst is getting to me, so why not an IPA to quench it? On to the beer: It's all good in looks; dense head, iron orange color in my glass, good retention. The nose is the expected NW IPA dose of lychee, grapefruit, and pine sap. As suggested the nose, this IPA goes towards the \"dirty hop\" side. Big smack of grapefruit, pine, lingering hop bitterness on the palate, and a hint of orange. The aftertaste of sap lingers softly. The beer has a smooth body with carbonation that doesn't seem like it's there. In all respects, a respectable IPA.","1256: As far as the look goes on this one, it looks kinda copper as I stare down into the can. Its a caldera baby, celebrate the can and drink from it. This is a nice smelling ipa, moderate amount of pine, and citrus. Smells like cascade hops. As far as taste its not scrape your tongue hoppy, but it is definitely flavorful. Has the bitterness in the corners of your mouth feeling. Its piney and floral. Mouthfeel is bubbly and a bit dry. Overall a very well rounded session ipa.","1283: Found this beer at Whole Foods in Tustin\u002fIrvine, CA. It was the first time I saw it, so I got two 6packs to try out. I was very pleasantly surprised. I try just about every IPA I can get my hands on: Sculpin, Racer 5, Hop Stoopid are some of my favorites. Big hoppy flavors and amazing fruity smells. You find these in Caldera IPA. This beer is delicious - if you like good hoppy and flavorful IPAs, give it a try, I bet you'll enjoy it.","1289: Review is from notes A: Orange, cloudy, head sticks around a while S: Smells like cat piss (not a bad thing strangely),very floral, hoppy T: Bitter up front, nice malt back, M: Easy to drink - mild carbonation D: All day long. Great offering from Caldera considering their PA wasn't all that great.","1299: Amber with hints of orange with big tan foamy head with good retention and uneven lacing. Big citrus hop aroma. Big bitter grapefruit up frony with good caramel mellowing backbone. Smooth, silky feel with a low carb feel despite the big foamy head. A good overhopped IPA that's pleasant yet slightly one dimensional. Not worth $13.50\u002f6 pack unless you really need a good IPA in a can.","1303: Appearance: Pours a hazy, yellow-orange body with a thin, wispy white head. Smell: Aroma of herbal, citrus hops accompanied by a honey-laden maltiness. Taste: Mild pale malts with a bit of toastiness and a soft honey-like sweetness. Citrus and bitter herbs. Medium bitterness. Finishes dry. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Drinkability: A fair pale ale, but I gotta say I enjoyed the Caldera IPA far, far more.","1334: Wierd tasting IPA, thrown in a trade. Starts OK, and then residual odd hop flavours. Medium yellow body, a quarter inch of white foam. A little hop aromas. Not skunky, but just another AMerican IPA to me, with moe astringency than balance. A bit aggressive carbonation.","1352: This one is eclipsed by the regular Caldera IPA that comes in a can unfortunately... I was looking for a more pronounced citrus bitterness and this was more floral and fragrant in nature... A different animal altogether and this somehow missed the mark for me... A fairly average brew with just a nint of hops to it and this bottle should be pretty fresh... This wasn't bad, mind you, but it just tasted and felt rather run of the mill to me...","1363: This was at the newer Caldera Tap House in Ashland (Rogue Brewery's old, original spot....) It was a little dark on the patio outside, but it certainly had an orange glow and appropriate lacing. Aroma had lavender, clementine, grapefruit pith, scented geranium and thai basil exploding from the glass. Delightfully potent hops without the poison-like bitterness or tannin. Don't get me wrong, I like big beers, but drinkability for a pitcher with friends is crucial and this fit the bill.","1386: Vintage 2010. A: Quarter finger light mocha fades to translucent of the same. Beer is dark, dark brown. No lacing to speak of. S: Extra roasty. Coffee, graham, cocoa, malt, licorice. I can say, however, the hops are still quite present. Piney, resiny. Malt dominant, but still hoppy. T: Roast, cocoa, coffee, lighter hops with earthy feel. Good beer. Not spending much time here, but this is really good. M: thick and syrupy. Like a good beer should be in this genre. D: this is a really good beer. I hate to be a slave to price point, but at nearly $13 for a bomber, I want to be wowed. The beer is good, really really good. If under $9\u002fbomber, I would be all about this one.","1433: Picked up a 6-pack at State Line in Maryland. Poured a golden amber with a good white head. This beer reminds me of Dale's Pale Ale, and not because of the can. There's a big punch of citrus and pine hops that's met (more so here than with Dale's) by a hit of caramel malt. Very drinkable and a tasty, more balanced IPA.","1490: Drank 11\u002f5\u002f11 A: A slightly reddish amber hue, with a head that dissipates quickly and completely. Intriguing simply because it's a different color. S: It smells like an orange chocolate bar. Not what I was expecting at all, but I like it. Not the most exceptional or complex beer I've had, but it's good. T: Again, orange chocolate. Mmm mmm good. Very well balanced, and not a hint of booze. M: Good intermediate body, but nothing special. O: I enjoyed this beer, but I much prefer Caldera's other offerings.","1583: Golden with a dense white head and a massive cascading of carbonation rising to the surface. Clean, sweet, graininess with a nice dose of floral\u002fcitric\u002f herbal hops. Cascades are definitely at work in this brew. Finish is dry and crisp with a perfect amount of bitterness. A more than solid Pale Ale from the folks at Caldera. This one is all West Coast.","1649: A: Poured a hazy amber color with a nice white cap S: Faded piney hops, caramel T: Caramel and faded hops battle for dominance while the metallic and old Earthy notes fight for second place. Bad. M: Medium to full body and not one I would recommend hiolding on your palate O: Poor IPA, drainpoured after two sips","1658: First micro brew for me in a can. Cool logo but with no freshness date. It pours a amber color with a nice sea foam head. The smell is strong of hops. The taste hits you with a dry hop appeal with a huge hop profile. It leaves a stinging pleasant aftertaste as it journeys down the throat. I really like the uniqueness of the this American IPA profile.","1682: poured into a tulip from a can with a two finger head and a deep copperish golden color with a slight reddish hue. smells like a slight twinge of alcohol and a floral yet citrusy hop aroma. and a sugary sweet malt backbone. Taste is bitterup front with a citrusy tongue with a sweet malt finish. relly quite impresive for my first craft beer from a can. super complex and tasty as hell. Mouth is suprisingly clean with a bite in the front. drinks moderately and really suprised me. For the cost I can't say it's worth it. 14.99 a six pack is steep for this one but it is a damn fine beer.","1690: Consumed 11\u002f4\u002f10 Got in a trade from ILikeBrew, thanks Micah for some Pacific Northwest Beer! Poured into Alchemist Brewery pint glass A: Pours clear dark orange with an inch of soapy head. Hangs to the glass pretty well to the bottom. S: Caramel malts, grapefruit, some pine resin T: Mild fruit up front, then the caramel\u002ftoasted malts in the middle. Finishes dry and bitter, nice punch. F: Slightly less than medium, with lower carbonation than I'd prefer. D: Pretty low carbonation for the big IPAs I'm used to drinking, so I could definitely do a few of these in a night.","1697: appearance - light amber color, just a little darker than I expected from the nose, big frothy head. Smell - very nice hop, pine, some fruit taste - nice hoppy grapefruite taste, dry finish mouthfeel - very even, not too thin, not too chewy for a single ipa overall - solid, I doubt I will pay $12.99 again for this brew and it probably factored into my rating","1709: Exceptionally pale yellow with vigorous carbonation, a light white head, fogged body, and full abstract lace. This simple session lager has a sustained head, a light appealing aroma, and enough Saaz to keep your feet tapping. Could use a catchier name though. Served on tap at the Siskiyou Pub, Ashland, OR.","1738: More of a 'dry' than a lager, tasted at the 2002 Oregon Brewers Festival. Orange color, orange flavor in nose. Light malts and fairly aggressively hopped; yet it is not very bitter. Interesting taste, complex and subtle. Light yet flavorful. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Nice beer. Would be a great beer to sip during a hot summer day.","1759: Standard lighter yellow pale ale here, good foamy head. Nice soft floral hop arrangement, if you like caldera, you'll be all good here. Plenty of taste in a pale, relative hefty amount of hops for style, light, ever so light toasting of the malt allows the hops to shine without making them exist in a ridiculous amount. Bitterness is sturdy, minty and metallic, but not a distraction or covering up the more delicate aspect of the beer, would say it leans to the grapefruit side of hop taste, cascade, chinook seem to be all over this one.","1801: Purchased in Portland during my spring break Pacific Northwest trip, the only bottle offering I've had from Caldera. Poured is a orange hued color. This IPA tastes maltier than the ones I used to have. Drinking at near room temperature made this even maltier-tasting, which isn't necessarily bad, but to me it tastes more like an amber than an IPA. It's a good beer but not outstanding.","1850: A: pours amber orange with a decent finger of off white head. S: grapefruit and light pine, and floral hop. There is some malt sweetness in the background. T: a nice tounge coating hop, that is piny, a citrus cross between grapefruit and orange. Malt is light but nicely sweet. M: coating hop, though the malt is light in the mouth, good carbonation. O: canned beer is really starting to grow on me, and leaves me impressed enough to try calderas other offerings","1882: Caldera- Pale Ale Picked up at Grape & Gourmet (VB) A- Light golden orange with a small fluffy white head. S- Light citrus and pine hops. Slight buttery maltiness. T- Buttery biscuity malt with a nice lemon\u002f grapefruit citrus and pine hop body. M- Buttery sweet and malty with a nice sweet and bitter hop bite. Overall- Nice malt\u002f hop balance. Very good sessionable can!","1885: This is a great beer in the canned beer arena. Had no option but to drink this straight from the can so I can't comment on appearance. Had a nice scent of bitter citrus and pine. Hops contribute a moderate bitterness consisting of both grapefruit and pine flavors, on top of a lightly sweet pale malt backbone.. Mouthfeel was crisp and pleasing with generous carbonation. Had a couple of these on a hike and found them to be great for the occasion.","1893: Smell is light, almost non-existent, must be trapped in the dark amber. Very light head tops a thin effervescent surface. Taste is belgian yet bitter, with very little of the promised oranges. I'm getting a lot of roast out of this, which normally would be a compliment but it just doesn't fit what I was expecting. Aside from the bitter notes the beer is pretty good, it's almost like a belgian strong dark coffee stout ale.","1905: Clear dark amber with a good three finger white head. Plentiful lacings. Aroma is fruity citrus hops with a bit of leather. Taste is full deep leathery bitter hops with the correct amount of malts. The label describes \"centennial hops\" as the mainstay of all that bitterness. Mouthfeel is just right, and drinkability is very good for this style. Kudos to Caldera for daring to bottle a limited production beer. Their normal regimen is cans. Cool label. Give the fellows from the \"State of Jefferson\" a big thumbs up! Keep it coming Caldera!","781: Pours a bright and clear amber color with a nice head. Aromas are subtle, some malts, and a bit of sweetness. Flavors are similar to that of brewed tea, with some malt sweetness and creaminess. The finish is crisp and a tad bitter from the hops. Mouthfeel is pretty good, a nicely carbonated beer. Very session worthy amber. Nothing special, but it's simple and tasty.","8: Pours a nice copper \u002f amber with a medium tan lasting head and nice lacing. Aroma of earthy piney hops, followed by some caramel malt and nice fruity bouquet. Taste is resiny earthy piney hops with some nice caramel maltiness and light fruity notes. Palate is nice crisp medium body with good carbonation. Finish is sweet caramel malt with some fruitiness ending with a good hoppy bitterness. Overall a seemed a bit on the hoppy side but seems to be well balanced, a good drinkable brew.","10: A: poured a caramel brown with a thin head that left a little bit of sticky lacing on the glass. S: at first I get caramel aromas with a underlying floral hop notes which had a good malt presence. There was also some citrus and bready notes as well. T: some nice piney hops pop out on the taste with caramel and citrus grapefruit accents that help out on the bitterness. It seems to have a decent malt backbone that helps out the balance. M: medium body with a low amount of carbonation that still works out but had a slight sweet and bitter hop finish. D: pretty good IPA that drank well and had a good amount of sweetness but lacked on the hop punch. It was still a tasty brew.","39: A can picked up in Baltimore. Pours a clear amber color with lots of foamy off-white head. Good retention leaves some spotty lacing. Smells of grassy hops, bread, caramel, and earth. Tastes of bread, toasted grains, caramel, lite citrus, and an earthy and grassy finish. Medium in body with good carbonation. Clean and smooth, malty and grainy with a nice bitter finish. Refreshing and easy to drink, a nice canned amber ale that I would definitely enjoy while out and about in the Summer time.","43: Had this on 2011-09-23 in Lynchburg, VA A - Almost clear, orange-amber with a 2-finger off-white head with big bubbles and moderate lacing. S - Fairly strong aroma that can be smelled 18\" away. Sweet malt, citrus and hop floral. T - Much like the aroma. Sweet bread and fruit followed by a dash of orange flesh a touch of spice and finally orange rind bitterness doesn't dominate. A pleasant, well-balanced bitter-sweet taste although it doesn't blow my hair back. M - Medium body and carbonation. A bit syrupy with some prickle O - I enjoyed this brew. It has a lot of flavor for being 6.1% ABV.","57: Again folks, I do enjoy a fruit beer every now and then, and this was a pretty decent brew, just not a stand out. A - pours an average reddish gold hue with light carbonation and a thin head S - Actually nice on the nose, delicate perfume with ginger, honey, and flowers up front. T - Pretty good, though nothing special, kind of girly, but would be nice to drink at the pool or beach M - light bodied and lacks stuffing, lots of acidity up front D - gets rather boring and a little too tedious after the first few sips.","61: From the can at SAVOR 2011. Pours a clear golden color with an average white head and a slight amount of white lacing on the way down. The nose brings quite a bit of citrus hop character, mostly tending toward grapefruit. Quite nice. The flavor has just a touch of malt in the background and is instead focused on a fairly-heavy hop presence. Orange and grapefruit come through and perhaps a bit of a floral character. Medium body with good bitterness. Nice and dry. Solid brew.","67: Pours a reddish orange with a thick off-white head. Lots of sticky lacing, head reduces down to nice crust. Smells of pine, grapefruit, and resinous hops. Nice hoppy flavor with citrus and pine notes. I tinge of malt as well. Medium bodied mouth feel and overall a very drinkable beer.","82: From a can an aggressive pour into a chalice. Looks nice. Dark golden clear color with a decent head. Lace layers nicely on the side of the glass. Aroma is very pleasing building anticipation and expectations. The taste isn't quite there however. The citrus is there - to a fault. A little too bitter with an unpleasing aftertaste. It's good, just not quite ready for the big time. With all the great beers Oregon has to offer the competition is too tough to rate this beer among the best. If they smooth out the edges with a little balance this can be a great beer.","88: 12oz can poured into a pint glass Pours a pretty amber-golden with a nice head a very pretty lacing. Smells delicious -- fresh and hoppy, citrus and floral and more hoppy. Taste is some honey up front and floral throughout with a strong hoppy bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, very slightly filmy, very slightly sticky. Very drinkable. Very pleasant. Nice to have a good beer in a can for those occasions where you can't use glass.","102: 12 oz bottle poured into Sam Adams glass. Good head and lacing, pours a deep amber. Aroma is citrus piney hops, with a bit of toffee. Taste has a great hop profile, bitter piney yet plenty of flavorful citrus fruit as well. Dry finish, medium viscosity. Overall a very nice west coast style IPA.","103: Pours a dark amber with a moderate head. Smell is pretty nice! Pine and tropical fruits. Taste starts with a nice blend of bitter pine and fruit punch, without being overly sweet. Pretty dry finish, medium-light mouth. This is a nice little surprise and drinkable but not complex enough to be interesting beyond one. But overall for what it is, Caldera has a winner.","121: A - Pours a clear light yellow with 3 fingers foamy white head. Lots of carbonation bubbles. S - Very nice malt aroma with floral and citrus hop aromas mixing nicely. T - Taste follows the smell with floral, citrus hop notes, mild bitterness, very rich caramel malt base. M - Light bodied, lots of carbonation, finish is all bittering hops. D - Good drinkability, very smooth and the flavors work well together.","125: Thanks to Djeucalyptus for these! Poured from the can to a tulip. Fairly clear pale orange with a sticky, long lasting head. Lots of lacing. Fairly pungent resiny, piney aromas. Taste is very piney right away. Good hop bite and very crisp and clean feel. Just a great, easy drinking ipa- right up there with other great ones as far as drinkablity. Great beer!","158: Pours a nice clear golden pale with foamy white head. Smells nice with very apparent herbal hop aroma. Taste is smooth with a nice crackery malt flavor and a big bitter hop finish. A tad overly bitter for your typical pale ale, maybe needs a bit more malt but I still like it. Plus it comes in a can which is a GREAT thing. Go cans.","188: The beer pours a nice gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a solid pale malt scent with some bisquity notes and a mild citrus hop aroma. There is a creamy\u002fbready character to it. The taste is good as well. It has a good hop bite up front along with a balance of pale and bisquit malts. It's quite a hoppy APA. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinking pale ale. It's crisp and bitter and very enjoyable.","196: Poured a very pale yellow. No head whatsoever. Some bready aroma, but very light. Very faint lemony flavor. Extremely light malt flavors that finished with a distinct light beer aftertaste. This beer shoud've been labeled as a light beer. Shame on me for buying a lager with an ABV less than 4. Almost any mass produced light beer is better than this one. I even drank it after mowing my lawn. Should've had a tall glass of water.","210: Thanks to Flexabull to sending me this one out in the vet BIF. I like canned brews that are good and this one fit the bill. Can poured into a strain pint glass produced a nice amount of white head that settled to a lace. The body was clear golden amber in color This brew had plenty of floral hops aromas coming from the glass I could tell this was a west coat brew. The flavor was very hop forward too. I think it was extremely close to an IPA in my book, but I have noticed more and more of the APA's heading in that direction. It was crisp and light in the mouth. The brew was quite enjoyable to drink and I easily could have drank a six pack at a BBQ","242: Big thanks to G311 for this one. A - Nice big IPA appearance: deep amber with a rich head, though lesser retention and lace. S - Really a very muted nose. It is nearly astoundingly so. T - The taste is quite a bit more, well, existent... because there is really nothing but a ghost of and IPA there in the aroma dept. A bit floral and grassy, and some caramel; tastes good, just not exceptional. M - IPA. A little flaccid. D - Doesn't measure up to the Red Racer IPA that preceded it (not that it was world-class, either). Probably not even as good as the regular Caldera IPA.","248: a: dark brown with amber highlights, no head or lacing. s: dark malts, medicine, little orange and rubbing alochol. t: malts, caramel, no medicine but dark fruits, other than bitters no other orange taste detected. m: full body with some bitterness. o: worth trying once, dont think i'll seek this one out again.","254: Pour was a surprisingly murky yet bright caramel color with an aggressive, sticky head. Big hops flavor up front - broadly bitter with floral and herbal notes, finishing up with a bit of pine resin. Substantial malt flavor, leaning toward caramel malt and a bit of toffee. Mouthfeel was almost chewy - no one will accuse this beer of being overly filtered.","266: Lovely orange-tan color, great lasting head, and plenty of lacing. A nice biscuit-malt aroma with crisp, fresh hops. Tastes like a great malty background with delectable hoppy bitter flavors dancing on your tongue. No shortage of pine or grapefruit either. Very balanced and flavorful. Easy to drink, with a good blend of ingredients producing a rich, smooth beer creation. Definitely a likable brew.","272: Poured into a 1\u002f2 liter stein a deep rich amber\u002fbronze with a fluffy one finger head that took its time fading.Sweet smoke,brown,sugar,a bit of alcohol in the nose,mellow and sweetish,I found it appetizing.Cherry wood sweetness and light peppery spice in the nose,its gentle sweet smoke instead of in your face,mellow but assertive enough.A real nice smoked bock beer,I will grab a few of these this fall while eating alot of smoked meat off my smoker.","323: Cloudy, brownish amber. Medium, foamy, off-white head. Some carbonation and a touch of lacing. Earthy, floral hop aroma, some bready malts. Flavor has more earthy hops, lots of bready, grainy malt. Heavy-ish body but not sweet. A nutty aftertaste. Odd for a west coast IPA; not hoppy at all but not much malt flavor or complexity going on either.","324: Pours an opaque black with a 3 inch puffy khaki head that settles to a small cap. A nice latticework of lacing forms on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, dark chocolate, and alcohol. Taste is of dark roasted malt, coffee beans, and cocoa powder. A mild roasty bitterness sticks around after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp but smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good RIS with a nice balance of aromas and flavors. This one took me by surprise.","327: Served from can into a Delerium Tremens tulip. Pours a hazy red-orange with a one finger off-white head that slowly subsides to minimal. Maintains decent lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt, hops, and pine. The flavor was of malt and a load of hops. It was medium on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a very nice IPA from a can no-less. Definitely worth seeking out if you are an IPA fan as it is quite drinkable and enjoyable. I will be having another in the near future.","339: appearance - highly carbonated, boastful head (2-3 in), transparent golden amber smell - resinous hops (simcoe?) taste - highly resinous, pine, pronounced hop flavor, some sweet malts to balance it out (very subtle though) mouthfeel - high carbonation, medium body, slightly dry finish drinkability - nice big resinous hop profile, true oregon\u002fwest coast ipa, bordering on a session beer if you can handle the hops!","342: Poured a slightly cloudy deep amber\u002fred color with a thin soap ring of head. The smell is amazing, big bacony smoked pork Rauch goodness. The taste follows the flavors nicely with a big smoked malt flavor with a nice bit of underlying sweetness, very pork like and very flavorful. Has a nice light bitterness in the finish that helps even it out very well. The mouthfeel is very slick and oily. Great Rauchbier!","348: copper or amber in color. pretty clear with an off-white hop head forming on top. smells of pine up front and a hit of citrus zest toward the back. taste is refreshingly hopped. malty sweetness amongst the pine, resins, and citrus. mouthfeel is crispy with a slight bite. definetly drinkable.","360: A- black with thin tan head. Good lace S- sweet, slight hint of esters\u002ffruit, roasted malt...typical porter nose T- similar to nose. Initial slight estery\u002ffruitiness transitions smoothly to roasty-sweet, coffee\u002fchocolate finish. One of the best balances of hops-malt I've had in a porter. M- full bodied, silky and slightly creamy. Perfect for the style. D- very sessionable....very close to perfect for the style","388: Poured from a can into my snifter. A - A clear golden orange, slightly burnt red color body with a medium frothy light white head. S - Very nice and big citrus hop smell that is smooth and sweet. Very pleasant. T & M & D - Great fruit sweetness up front that is refreshing and almost minty cool. Then some bigger malty sweetness on mid palate and the slight fruit acidity cleans the end and brings in some slight airy floral notes. The mouth is light and very drinkable, I go back to refreshing. O - Awesome IPA and I love the can. They really pull of the style well. One of my favorites that I come back to often. -Cheers","409: 12 oz. can tried 20 Jul 2009. Poured in the 0.5 L Adambrau becker. Extra large fizzy beige head. Light carbonation. Faintly hazy golden orange color. Citric and buttery toffee aroma. Grapefruit pithiness to start and throughout. Moderate caramel and toastiness. Somewhat buttery (A is ok with that in an IPA). Bittersweet lingering aftertaste. Moderate ethnanol. Medium body. Just don't like the butteriness in IPAs...","440: Poured from the can into a tulip. Nice pour, perfect carbonation, nice medium head, solid lacing. Aroma is a perfect IPA balance of malt and citrusy piney hops. Taste matches aroma perfectly, this is a very balanced IPA. One weakness for me is the mouthfeel is the slightest bit thin. For all the flavor and aroma I would like it a bit \"chewier\". Very solid IPA.","446: A-Gold-light bronze. Big eggshell head. Brilliantly clear. S-Piney, citrusy hops. Crackers. Slight soapiness after a while. T-citrus rinds, some pine. Firm bitterness. Bitterness hides much of the malt but some crackery malt comes through. M-medium light bodied. Medium carbonation. No alcohol burn. really nice. D-Really nice beer. A bit on the bitter side to drink all night but a really tasty beer.","483: Pours a very pale straw yello color with frothy white head, quickly dicipating but decent lacing. Smell is dominated by piney, earthy hops with a presence of citrus and floral. Pale straw like malts. Taste is a mirror of these scents, not much complexity, but good. Medium bodied, adequate carbonation. Definitely a refreshing, milder alternative to many pale ales currently out there.","486: Apperance: Orange-y, light amber. Lacing left on the glass. Smell: Nice citrus hop aroma thats pretty minimal of a NW IPA, a nice chance. Taste: Malt flavor is rapidly replaced with a pretty bitter lasting hop finish. T Mouthfeel: darn easy drink.... Drinkability: Tasty beer, Id drink this again.","488: The beer pours a hazy dark golden\u002famber color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pale and Carapils scent along with a huge citrus hop aroma. There is a light breadiness as well. The taste is very good. It's light with a damn bitter hop taste. It's loaded with citrus goodness. The malt bill provides some balance, but this is a hop heavy beer. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great session IPA. It refreshingly hoppy and easily drinkable.","491: Super clear orange body with a frothy sticky head that lasts the whole beer, very impressive appearance. Smells sweet, pine, citrus, biscuity, earthy. Taste is very malty with very little bitterness which i was not expecting as this is an IPA and should have more hop profile the taste. A little too malty for my liking.","512: What a classic pale ale, sent courtesy of unclejedi via the CEO BIF! And in a can, too! Poured a clear amber, mixed together with a golden hue. Sheets of white lace clung to the sides, excellent. Lite floral and citrus in the aroma, progressing into the taste which added pine and a squeeze of grapefruit. Sharp, crisp and dry this would be an excellent on the go brew for any outdoor activity. Hats off for this one!","552: A: Very pale golden color with pretty much no head whatsoever. S: Kind of weird but a little intriguing as well. Lots of rose petals and rose water here. Some faint hints of yeast and bread as well. T: Yeah, this isn't good. Lots of floral notes but there's no hint of the base beer here at all. A bit of a buttery note with some yeast, but that's about it. Mouthfeel is waaay thin and watery.","558: Thanks to Kegatron for hooking me up with a can. Pours a clear amber color with 3 fingers of tall foamy off-white head. Great retention leaves lots of lacing stick. Smells of caramel, pine, grapefruit, and spicy hops. Tastes of toasted grains, caramel, citrus fruits, and bitter spicy and earthy hops in the finish. Medium in body with good carbonation. Crisp and balanced with a nice woodsy bitter finish. Easy to drink and enjoyable. A solid sessionable IPA that has me looking forward to trying more stuff from Caldera.","568: Pours dark brown, with amber edges; light tan head that quickly falls to leave decent lacing. Smell is faint chocolate and stale coffee, smokiness. Taste is better, slight sweet chocolate, slight coffee, and minimal smoky oak, almost salty at times. Mouthfeel is medium, carbonation is medium high, overall drinkability is good for a light stout. Not something I'd seek out again, certainly wouldn't refuse it if offered.","586: Pours out a little thin looking weak ice tea color with two fingers of slightly off-white suds and lots of lacing. Smell is strong citrus and grapefruit rind. This is a great smelling beer. Taste is piney and grapefruity with slight sugar. Mouthfeel is very clean for such a big hop brew. Not sticky at all. Very quaffable. Overall I would have to give this a 4 even though it's really in the 4.12 range. Only reason not to give it a 4.5 is the cost of this stuff. 16 dollars in Ky.","616: Pours dark nice amberish color head. Smell is hoppy piney goodness Taste is hoppy (of course) I detected a tiny hint of citrus with followed by a nice grassy piney after taste. went down smooth and a wee bit creamy great beer to start the night out with. all and all typical Hopped out beer, but price VS quality one of the best out there.","618: Pours a nice clear and bright amber color with a decent head, and a bit of lacing. Aromas are pine like, earthy, pungent and resiny. Smells a bit funky, but not bad. Taste is crisp, biting, with some sharp brewed tea flavors up front. Hint of hard candy sweetness, and light creamy malt flavors. Finish is bitter, earthy, grassy, and dry. Mouthfeel is very good. Very full, smooth, and nicely carbonated. Overall, an interesting and tasty beer. A but different than most IPAs brewed on the West Coast, unique, and rough around the edges, but I like it.","621: Appearance: Golden amber with the slightest haze and a nice sticky two finger head. Smell: Lots of signature cascade aroma - citrusy with a touch of pine. Taste & mouthfeel: Juicy citrus hop flavors supported by a dry biscuity malt backbone. Medium-light in body, crisp, dry. Moderate bitterness in the finish, though it doesn't linger too long. Very clean stuff, and incredibly drinkable. This reminds me quite a bit of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, but more raw and flavorful.","633: A: Pours a clear golden color, not too much head or lacing down the glass S: Grassy\u002fpiney type hop scent, nothing too fragrant though T: Mild sweetness followed by a nice crisp grassy\u002fherbal hop flavor M: Light to medium bodied, carbonation is pretty good O: This is a nice summer BBQ beer, I think i may like their amber better but this one is a decent pale.","649: A-Full bronze. big light tan head. brilliantly clear. S-Some toasty malt. Light citrus hop aroma. Not a lot going on. T-Carmelly malty. Firm bitterness but more balanced to the malt than their Pale ale. Not much in the way of hop flavor. Lots of bitterness but not much flavor. M-medium bodied. medium carbonation. No alcohol burn. D-An average tasting IPA. Needs more hop flavor and aroma. Bitterness and malt are spot on. Still not a bad beer.","660: Can from Beerzack. Thanks! Pours Semi-clear reddish amber witha big lasting chunky whitish head that leaves lots of lacing. Smell is sweet fruity, fresh and hoppy. Very nice. Taste is smooth with fruity caramel and fresh citrusy, and sweet orange flavored hops and bitter citrus rind. Nice and strongly bittered which lasts in the finish but with a light lingering sweetness too. Very good IPA.","661: Nice amber color with a great head and lacing, plus it's in a can! Love it when beers are in cans. It smells piney and earthy and gains in the taste. Earthy Munich malts balance with a lot of citrusy and herbal northwestern hops, with some metallic and peppery notes sneaking in to make a solid but not outstanding IPA. Slight stickiness to the mouthfeel, but very drinkable overall.","683: No Canned on Date A - Pours a rich amber color. Completely clear, with minimal head. S - Sweet hoppy syrupy smells. Hints of piney resin. T - Piney, resin, floral hops. No noticeable citrus qualities. Finishes very dry and bitter. M - Medium body with moderate to high carbonation. Just right for an IPA. D - Nothing I would go out of my to get again, but nothing I'd turn down either. This is a solid IPA. Not a lot to rant about, both positive and negative. The flavors are pretty one dimensional, bitter piney hops, no citrus undertones that I enjoy so much.","694: Drank on tap at Old Town Pizza in Portland in pint glass. A: Solid amber hue; lacing in glass. S: Slightly grass smell, hoppy notes on the nose. T & M: This was a quite hoppy pale ale but not overly so, this is a nicely done pale ale. D: Highly drinkable, this is a pale ale that could definitely be sessionable. I really enjoyed this beer but get a feeling that I'll have a hard time finding this in Dallas.","698: Appearance: Orange-amber with a slight haze to it. The eggshell colored head retains remarkably well, leaving a ton of sticky lace behind. Smell: Floral with a bit of resiny pine and grapefruit. Great hop aroma with no noticeable malt presence. Taste & mouthfeel: Malty but very dry. Floral and resiny hop flavors follow, leading way to a bitter finish with a hint of grapefruit. The medium-light body and restrained ABV make this one seriously drinkable IPA.","718: A - Poured out a clear, orange color with gold highlights. It had a foamy, fizzy, one-finger layer of white foam that left minimal lacing. S - It had a moderately grassy aroma with notes of orange. It also had a gentle caramel scent. T - It tastes of bitter grassy hops with a snappy, spice flavor. The ale also had a burnt toast maltiness. M - It was sharp and lively on the tongue. A light bodied pale ale. D - This is a pleasant tasting pale ale. It's nice to have a sessionable ale in a can.","720: A - Dark gold, almost amber ale with a nice, dense, bubbly head that descends slowly and leaves nice lacing. The head revives with a swirl. S - Pine and grapefruit with a touch of wet leather. T\u002fM - Hops and leather with a touch of pine and grapefruit. Nicely supportive carbonation. The trick was to let it warm up a bit. As it warmed, it became more complex and rich. When it was cold it came across as a bit thinner so choose\u002fmake your preference. D - The alcohol is in check. If you choose to drink it cold it's ideal as a warm weather ale. Otherwise, enjoy it with seafood (e.g., mussels). Yum.","722: Nice dark orange colured ale, small lightv tan head. I dont like the aroma, it certainlly has hops aplenty, but has a sour ,sweaty work sock aroma that puts me off in the background. The flavor is better, very strong oniony hopping, pink grapefruit and spruce tips. Thin and maybe even a tad under carbonated. I dint really dig this one. I liked their Pale Ale way better.","730: A: Poured from a can to a pint glass. Had an orangey color and a cloudy texture. There was a half inch of foamy, long-lasting head and very good lacing. S: A nice aroma of citrus, hops, and a slight maltiness. T: Tasted of hops, pine, citrus, and some caramel malt. A very Western-type flavor for an IPA. M: A well-carbonated beer with a dry, crisp finish. Medium-bodied. D: A very drinkable beer that helps to dispell the myth that only bad beers come in cans.","741: I got this beer from Tilley4. Thanks Jason! 12oz can served in a standard pint glass. L - slightly hazed copper color with a bone white head that left trails of lacing. S - citrus rind and a slab of butter rolled in dirt. T - bitter citrus rind upfront with some buttery notes before getting dry and tart on the finish. F - medium bodied with a biting feel and smooth carbonation. D - goes down quick and easy.","766: Pours amber, bordering on orange. Completely white, fluffy head. Pine sap and floral bouquet for aroma. Malt sweetness is also detectable in the nose. Taste is grassy, piny, spicy. Assertive but balanced, caramel malt is present. Big merit on drinkability, a simple and flavorful IPA. Finishes clean, nice and smooth. This would be a great \"every day\" IPA, but I guess, so would Pliny.","769: Pours out a clear, amber\u002forange with a 2-finger, thick, white head that leaves moderate, splotchy lacing. The smell is both fruity and malty, malt dominates. Taste is fruity, citrus hops up front then overtaken by a strong malt flavor and finishes with bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium, well-carbonated at first but low later. Drinkability is fine. I like it and many of those who like IPAs will also.","777: Poured from the can a slightly-hazed amber gold with a huge frothy off-white head. Juicy aroma of grapefruit and pine hops and sweet, bready malts. Hoppy bitterness upfront with the grapefruit and pine. Sweet malts and caramel offer a good balance. Lighter bodied, crisp and dry, with a moderate carbonation. A super sessionable and flavorful IPA from Caldera. A bit steep at $12 a sixer, but then again, I'd much rather have one of these outdoors than most other options.","778: 12 oz can poured into duvel snifter A - pours a deep amber, very lively, large white head that stays for a bit, very good looking beer S - huge citrus notes, absolutely amazing smelling beer T - amazing citrusy grapefruits and oranges amazing IPA, absolutely, the bitterness is perfectly balanced M - very smooth, creamy, easy to drink O - the best IPA I have ever had, absolutely amazing beer","783: Poured from the can into a glass tumbler. Nice aroma and pale yellow appearance. Nice fluffy head and fair amount of lacing. Taste was a big surprise, I thought any beer from a can would be a let-down. The initial malt sweetness was nicely balanced by the hop bitterness. Not like an IPA for sure but impressive anyway. Mouthfeel was O.K. and drinkability was good. Made with whole flower Cascade hops.","808: It has a dark bronze and amber body. The head and lace are full, rocky and tan. The aroma is sweet but there is some yeast spice and little floral accents. It reminds me of a pale ale flavor a bit bitter, grapefruit like but has a sweet melon finish. The mouthfeel is medium. The carbonation had a lot of staying power.","832: Hazy apricot color with a solid frothy eggshell colored head with great retention and lacing. Visible carb at the edges. Nice floral and grapefruit hop notes on the nose. Good clean flavors. Nice mild hop notes up front with the same characteristics as the nose balanced well with the middle-backended caramel maltiness. Hops create a slightly bitter aftertaste. Mouth is crisp with a bit of a zip and high carb. Overall it's a good pale ale. A perfect beer to have in a can like it is, being a perfect beer to have while camping, golfing, fishing etc.","837: A - Poured out a slightly hazy, auburn\u002famber color with a thick, foamy, tan, two-finger head. It left some nice lace. S - It smelled of tons of pine. Sweet notes of grapefruit and orange peel. T - It was very peppery and spicy with a smooth burnt toast maltiness. Some subtle citrus flavors, too. M - It was crisp and sharp. A light to medium-bodied beer. D - This is a pretty good IPA. Here in the Midwest the price tag was a bit high, though.","839: My first beer from this brew...and what a goodie! Over a finger of off-white head lingers over a translucent amber. The head lives a good amount of sticky lacing all over the glass. Aromas of floral and herbal hops with a sweet but bready maltiness as a distance backbone. Earthy notes in both the aroma and taste. Tons of bitter residuals linger on the palate, thanks in part to a medium mouthfeel. This is a delicious IPA, and I look forward to grabbing more cans from this brewery!","849: Poured from a can into a standard pint glass. Beer is orange and clear. Tight white head forms and when it falls away leaves lacing on the glass. Carbonation is medium. Aroma is good but pretty simple. It is piney hop aroma and not much else, I may detect a little sweetness. It is attractive. Clean drinking beer, good bitterness all at the back finishes nearly completely. I would describe this as well balanced. As you drink it the aftertaste builds on you slightly, still a very drinkable beer. Body is medium, which is fine. I like this IPA.","883: Snagged a can of this after seeing that it's got such a positive amount of reviews. The beer poured out as a clear yellowish gold color, it has a pretty good looking soapy head on it. The lacing is a little sticky but not too much. The smell of the beer has a really nice malty and hoppy aroma. The hops smell bright and fruity. The taste of the beer was pretty good. The hops were definitely in there ready to hit ya in the mouth. The malt cleaned up the mess in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was light and refreshing. Overall it was a pretty good IPA.","887: Decidedly crimson, clear, with just under a finger of slightly off-white head with lowish retention. Good citrus-Cascade nose, but not quite as strong as I would have expected. A straightforward, dryish, slightly caramelly amber ale with a good dose of citrus hop flavor. Nothing too complicated, and entirely pleasing, though I found myself yearning for just a little more malt in the background. I love it when hop juice becomes hop syrup...","891: A - pours an amber color with a two finder head that is retained for a good 5-10 minutes. The beer is almost as clear as a lager...not cloudy at all. S - very strong citrus smells. T - similar to the smells, the first predominant taste is citrusy. After that, you get a hint of caramel. Then the hops come through and leave a nice bitterness finish. D - I love this IPA. It's one of my favorites! It's exactly how a west coast IPA should taste. The only issue could be a slight lack in carbonation.... But I find that true of most craft can beer I try.","901: Pours a nice golden peach color with a frothy long lasting ivory head. Smells of earthy grassy hops and a little citrus. Great tasting with plenty of bitterness and some grapefruit. Just enough of a malt backbone to let those grassy hops shine. A medium-bodied and flavorful IPA available in a can that reminded me of a nicer version of 60 min. If the price point were lower, I'd drink this a ton.","907: I assume this is fairly fresh as it is the first time I have seen it at my favorite beer store. Pours clear amber with a one finger white head. Fair lacings. Aroma is very hoppy for the style. Taste is quite hoppy earthy slight citrus and a firm but not overly sweet backbone. Medium dry mildly bitter finish. A bit astringent on the palate. Not sweet and cloying like most American Ambers. I think this is a bit on the bitter side for the style. Which would make it closer to a PA which I like very much. So for my tastes this is fine. If you enjoy your ambers on the sweeter side you better pass on this beer.","923: This is indeed quite tasty. The jet black color is very nice not very much light getting through this beer. The head is sticky and light brown. The hops are prominent along with a ton of roasted chocolate flavors and wood in the aroma and taste. The mouthfeel is semi thick, a little oily. The beer overall is really nice.","924: A: Dark amber in color, the head was amazing. Slighly off white head, with enough retention to balance the can on it if I wanted to. S: Lots of citrus and piney hops. T: Wasn't sure what to expect from my first \"real\" can of beer. It was very well balanced. You had a good citrus and piney resin working together on this one. M\u002fD: It had good carbonation, the end was mildly bitter and oily. I thought this was a great first for me.","932: A - hazey orange in color with a rocky white head which quickly dissipates to a thin film. S - the nose is rich with hops. piney and fruity. sweet caramel malt notes and some cherry esters. T - clean, lightly sweet malt upfront followed by some piney bitterness and a long cherry\u002fsweetish finish. M - smooth, creamy, a touch watery and a full zippy carbonation. O - nice IPA with lots of piney notes but could've had a bit more bitterness on the tongue.","952: Golden amber with a big foamy head that just floats on top. Crisp pale malt and floral hop aromas. Flavors of light floral hops with a good malty reflection that combine to make a honey-like finish with a light hop linger. Medium carbonation with a non descript mouthfeel. It might not look like much but it tastes great although there's also not much to talk about in the mouthfeel. I really liked the honey I tasted in the finish.","976: 12 oz. can with a slightly different look from the one shown above. No freshness date Poured a bright, clear orange with a half-inch white head. Very subdued fruity aromas which quickly fade. This is the least impressive character of this ale. The ale begins with a pleasant bitterness that lingers on the tongue. There is a very faint metallic flavor that quickly faded. Overall, this is dry and refreshing. Noticeably carbonated with a light body. The mouthfeel is clean and refreshing. While not very complex, this is a summer quaffer with its light, refreshing body and slight fruity bitterness.","981: 22oz bottle into snifter. 2011 vintage. from notes. Pours black with a thick mocha colored head that dissipates fairly quickly. The aroma is of cocoa, with roasty malts. I can just barely pick up notes of the licorice. The taste follows the nose fairly well. Cocoa mixed with astringent coffee, though the licorice is more pronounced then in the aroma. The mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied with subtle carbonation. This was quite drinkable, and left me a very good impression of the brewery.","989: a: This was a very pale, clear golden color. It was served to me with craggy, sticky head that stuck around for awhile. s: Big piney hop nose with a little lemon. t: This tasted very fresh. Sweet flavors of toffee and then a big piny hop blast at the end. m: Fabulous carbonation, long lasting. Perfect. d: One of the best IPAs I've tried. Great stuff.","1002: Pours a clear burned orange with a creamy head that dies somewhat quickly and little to no lacing. Smells like a hop bomb with strong citrus, rind and a tiny bit of floral. Blows away your taste buds with hops and a bite of citrus. The balance isnt as great as it could be but this sure is tasty, especially if you are a hop head. Finishes wonderfully dry and bitter but doesnt linger too long on the tongue. Carbonation is perfect. A very drinkable and delicious IPA....and from a can no less.","1004: A - Poured a copper color with a big off white head that leaves a ton of lacing behind S - Is a nose full of hops that are both citrus and piney with a touch of caramel malt kicking around T - Follows the nose hops upfront more pine than citrus with the caramel malt trying to come through to add some balance M - This beer has a medium body with higher carbonation to it D - I'm enjoying this IPA quite a bit I don't know if it coming from a can is making me like it more but this beer tastes good and is worth a try if you see it around","1009: Pours a clear gold color, with a big impressive white head. Nice hoppy cascade nose. Floral, and pine like. Beer has a pretty light quality. But is still tasty. Light crisp hop flavor, a bit of malty sweetness and creaminess, and a slightly piney and resiny hop finish. Nice simple APA. Mouthfeel is pretty good. As mentioned, it's a bit light, but still feels nice in the mouth. Drinkability is very good. Light and easy drinking, yet still a tasty APA. Session worthy. I love canned craft beer!","1019: This beer poured out as a nice golden color, almost copper. The head was fluffy and white, left behind a strong lacing too. The smell of the beer was floral and citrusy. The taste of the beer has a sweet bitterness, plenty of citrusy grapefruit flavors and a touch of malt in the back end. The mouthfeel has a good bite to it, with a dry aftertaste. Overall it's a good IPA, I am glad I tried it for sure.","1021: Wonderful fluffy full headed porter. Great esspresso aromas, roasted coffee. Salty under taste..this is minor yet sets the theme for the porter..the saltiness makes you gulp more of the chocolaty ,.coffee goodness. Great drinking beer..with great backing.","1031: Tapped this open and a fruity piney smell, Cloudy golden orange color when poured in a pint glass. Nice foaming thick head. Big and hoppy, yet smooth as butter. Minimal hop after taste (I like this, so was a liittle disappointed with the lack there of there) However, a delicious beer. Would drink it anytime!! I bet on draft it is a delight!","1064: Poured into tulip glass. Appearance: Deep mahogany with red hue, pours 1 finger of off-white head that fades quickly. Lots of lacing. Smell: Roasted malt, chocolate, orange zest, slightly boozy as it warms, raw sugars. Taste: roasted malt, chocolate, blood orange, sweet, brown sugar. Mouthfeel: full bodied, good carbonation. Overall: A tasty porter. I like the subtle blood orange element. Not a lot going on here, but what there is is quite good. Drinkability is above average.","1065: Split the bomber with my girlfriend who picked it out because of the roses. Pours a clear gold\u002forange with a small white head. Smells floral as expected with some malty sweetness too. Not really picking up heavy roses on the nose. Tastes weirdly floral, but not good floral like a heavily cascade hopped beer. Hardly any hops at all, just a weird rose flavor. Good news is if I ever want this flavor again, I have a large rose bush in my front yard. Undercarbonation leads to an even worse experience. My first drain pour in quite a while. After a few sips these became way too overpowering and going through 22 oz wasn't happening.","1073: Thanks to 5000 for sending this can my way. The beer pours a dark amber color with a white head. Darker than expected. The aroma is very nice. I get a lot of grapefruit and pine notes. The flavor is similar. The predominant flavor is some resiny pine from the hops but I also get some grapefruit. The toffee and caramel malt backbone balance out the beer nicely and keep the bitterness level fairly low for a west coast IPA. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very nice.","1111: Bomber pours a clear straw yellow body with a small vanilla head that quickly drops into some scattered lacing. Aroma has some crackery malt and a hint of floral hops. Mouthfeel is light bodied with a spritzy carbonation. Taste is dominated by a crackery pilsner type maltiness that is balanced by a dry grassy and floral hoppiness. Reminds me of kolsch. Unpretentious and unoffensive. A decent lawn mower beer, I suppose.","1113: Pours dark amber with a short white fizzy head that fades fast. Aroma is BBQ and smoked pork, some sweet malt and a touch of chocolate. Flavor starts out like a smoked pork sandwhich, nice smooth lagered finish. Smoke and sweet malt stick in the mouth something fierce. A beer that performs as advertised, smoke meat and lager all in one, not really a style I want more than one of but still tasty.","1121: A- Aggressive pour yields a three inch off white head. Beer itself is a somewhat cloudy dull light orange. Awesome head retention with above average lacing. S- Bright citrus notes...think lemons, oranges. T- Follows the nose. With a noticeable, but not overpowering, dose of hops on the back end. Well balanced. Alcoholic orange juice, mmmph. M- Medium mouthfeel. Carbonation is lacking a bit it seems. D\u002fO- One of the better pale ales I've had in awhile. Drinkability is the tits...and in cans no less! First Caldera offering is a winner in my book.","1126: Poured from a can into a pint glass A - Amber in color with a thick, off-white head. S - Not as much hop aroma as I had hoped. There is some citrusy hop aroma and a bit of stickiness to it. T - better hop character in the taste. Good malt backbone to balance the hops. The finish is a bit chalky and biscuity. M - The biscuitiness interferes with the mouthfeel to me. A bit too thick on the tongue for an IPA. D - Nothing unpleasant about the way this one goes down. Alcohol is well masked and the carbonation level is right where it needs to be.","1136: A- Pours a nice amber color with a whit head. S- Hops with a citrus tone hint of malt. T- Hops and citrus tones with a hint of a malt finish. M- Semi dry with hop flavors through out sip and a malt finish. D- Pretty good beer from Oregon. I can drink this again with no worries. Cheers...","1143: Pours a bronze\u002famber color with a thick, creamy, fluffy white head. Dies down and leaves a lot of lacing along the side of the glass. Smell is highly, bitterly hopped. I think I can smell mt. hood hops, pine, black pepper, grass\u002fweedy smell, earthy. Taste is completely bittering with a smooth body. Black pepper in the taste, as well as that earthiness to it. Light carbonation brings out the slight malty flavors. Mostly though its pretty hoppy.","1145: Was pretty excited to see some limited 22's from Caldera down this way. Interesting art work on the bottle. A-ruby, brown almost a dark mahogany, small half finger head and translucent S-Orange, cherry and chocolate-Terry Chocolate Orange upfront, a faint grassy smell in the end T- light malts and belgian yeast. light orange and cherries with a slight bitterness on the end M-watery, light carbonation, not much body to it D-Overall, the taste was interesting but light, I wish it tasted as good as the smell was. There was not much body to this one for being a strong dark Belgian.","1152: A= basic blonde, mild white head, decent lacing. S= honey and floral hops notes. More evident as the beer warmed for a few minutes. T= immediately astringent and dry, somewhat watery, some florals, pine, bitters. M= astringent, some bitterness, florals. D= fine if you like it, depends on the price versus better APA offerings.","1155: A: In a pint glass. Clear amber, nice yellowish head. S: Piney, citrusy hops. Malty, bready, herbal. T: Like smell. Bitter. I like this. MF: Like most beers for me, not remarkable; standard for the style. D: Very drinkable. It's a little pricey and only sold by the can. But if it were cheaper\u002fsold in 6 packs here I'd definitely pick up a sixer.","1168: A: Poured a pale amber color, clear with good carbonation leaving a nice white head S: Light caramel, hops, bitterness, some citrus and floral notes T: Floral and citrus with impressive hops, def a American West Coast IPA here. M: Lighter bodied with hop bitterness leaving a crisp, bitterness D: Good. I actually thought this could have been a modest single IPA as well","1179: Pours a clear very light yellow with strong carbonation but a weak head. The aroma is sweet, non-descript malt with just a touch of grassy hops and some graininess. The flavor is quite similar with pale malt sweetness, some grassy herbal hops, clean yeast, grainy notes and a surprising amount of bitterness. I have to say that the flavor is pretty disappointing, even for this style, though the dryness does give it some merit. Mouthfeel is not just light, but watery. It has a nice dry finish and is very quaffable, and holds up alright when compared to other beers in this category, but I think there are better options.","1199: A: An amazingly clear, golden pour from can into glass with a fluffy white head that sits on top. S: Just as a pale ale should be: a refreshing citrus aroma with a mild pine to let you know that it still means business. T: Again, a perfect example of a pale ale. A nice clean, refreshing citrus flavor followed by a nice bitter bite on the finish. M: The beer is light and moderately carbonated, but still has a fairly substantial feel on the tongue. D: This must be what Bud is talking about. These guys sure know how to make a great session pale and IPA. I'm glad to see these beers become more easy to come by in CA.","1238: This beer pours a dark amber color, with a perfect size head that did dispate quickly. The smell is strongly of malts, and a smokyness. The taste starts off very malty, smoked flavors, then finishs with a smoked sausage like flavor. The aftertaste is strongly of a smoked meat; and the flavor stays on your palette for some time, also nicely carbonated. Overall fantastic beer, very odd, but still enjoyable.","1260: A - Pours a medium amber color with a 1-2 finger head with some lacing. S - You get hit with the regular Pine and Citrus but also some sweet malt on the back end T - Flavor was thinner than some IPA's but still nice with the Pine and Citrus, almost a little too much malt on the back end for me and not as smooth as I would have hoped. M - Crisp IPA light\u002fmedium body with medium carbonation. D - Pretty Good. The best canned IPA I have had, although it was my first canned IPA. Next time I think I would rather have two Pliny's to a six pack of this.","1261: A: Poured a copperish orange color with good carbonation and a nice white head S: Caramel, bread, pine and light booze T: Taste follows nose pretty well. Balanced, with a good caramel and breadiness, floral and pine notes M: Nice lingering bitterness and sweet, sticky feel D: Good","1276: Poured from a 12oz can into a nonic. Thanks to BA redbird. This brew pours a cloudy golden-amber color crested with two fingers of head that retains well and leaves great lacing. The smell is great. Hops, grapefruit, and some caramel malts. A normal IPA nose, but done well. The taste is that of a well-done, well-balanced IPA. The malts and hops are quite harmonious, neither taking over too far. There's some ever present grapefruit here as well. The aftertaste does bring in a great deal of hop resin over malts. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both solid. Just a well-done IPA.","1284: Clear orange-copper, or weak iced-tea in color with fine foamy covering that leaves some nice lace. Nice perfumy cascade-like aroma. Some citrus, pine and floral hops. Assertively hoppy. Lots of woodsy pine and some citrus peel. Kinda astringent bitter finish. Slightly stingy aggressive carbonation does not help the already astringent character of the beer. Pretty drinkable, despite the astringent impression.","1290: Great looking 12oz can poured into pint glass. Pours a golden amber color with tons of frothy head and gobs of lacing on the sides of the glass. Very piney hoppy smell. Taste is a slap in the tongue with pine followed by orange citrus. Amazing hop profile on par with super hopped double\u002fimperial IPA's. Light dry mouthfeel that really dries out your mouth. Great drinkability hindered only by the hop blast that will quickly leave your taste buds dulled. Overall this is an amazing IPA that blows my mind every time I drink it.","1299: Amber with hints of orange with big tan foamy head with good retention and uneven lacing. Big citrus hop aroma. Big bitter grapefruit up frony with good caramel mellowing backbone. Smooth, silky feel with a low carb feel despite the big foamy head. A good overhopped IPA that's pleasant yet slightly one dimensional. Not worth $13.50\u002f6 pack unless you really need a good IPA in a can.","1303: Appearance: Pours a hazy, yellow-orange body with a thin, wispy white head. Smell: Aroma of herbal, citrus hops accompanied by a honey-laden maltiness. Taste: Mild pale malts with a bit of toastiness and a soft honey-like sweetness. Citrus and bitter herbs. Medium bitterness. Finishes dry. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Drinkability: A fair pale ale, but I gotta say I enjoyed the Caldera IPA far, far more.","1304: Poured amber from the can. Nice one inch head with plenty of lacing. Aroma is earthy citrus hops and a bit of sweet malt. Flavor is usual hops citrus and pine in this case. Nice balance of hops and malts with hops dominating. Good mouthfeel not too watery. Amazingly good canned beer! Highly recommended if you enjoy IPA's. Try the APA also.","1314: Red mahagonny. Yellow tinted head, thick full and dense, holds itself with stern authority. Sticky lacing also. Great hop aroma. Thick citrus fruit with berry components. A bready sweet malt really mends well with the abundance of fruit. Impeccably balanced. Nothing out of the ordinary necessarily but one of those brews that is just dead on. Bitter finish with fruit driven mid palate and a toffee core, all intertwined with dried berry puree. Nice and thick and drinkable.","1331: 12oz can poured into a pint Pours a hazy golden color with a fluffy white head. Some nice staying power and spider web lacing. The aroma is musty and earthy with layers of pine and orange. On the palate, this guy is a little more pine and citrus forward while the earthy, musty hops come through in the middle. The finish is earthy bitter with a touch of pine resin. Light medium body with good carbonation. This is a nice pale ale that deserves a spot in any rotation. Borderline sessionable.","1347: 12oz can. A) Pours with a tight, creamy head. Takes a bit to settle. Hazy body, amber in color. Sticky lacing. S) Piney. Grapefruit. Caramel. T) Well balanced flavor combination. Caramel. Orange. Starts a little bit bitter then moves right into the malty sweetness. Finishes with a hop bit and subtle spruce and alcohol. M) Crisp up front then smooths out. Medium body. D) A well crafted brew. I'd definitely drink another one.","1353: Nice amber color and sticky white head. Light hop presence backed by a strong malt body and a bit of yeast. A bit flowery and sweet. Tastes solidly malty with a decent hop touch. A bit sour on the finish but otherwise not bad at all. Finishes smooth as well. Not bad, a more enjoyable amber and very nice looking to say the least.","1375: 12oz can into nonic. Crystal clear honey amber hue with a thick two finger head that seems to last forever. The malts are well hidden behind very aromatic piney hops. A little bit of honey is in the background. Though the hops are sharp, the seem slightly subdued. Toasty grains set the base, which linger throughout. The hops provide a citrusy and bitter flavor, with a little bit of lingering sweet fruit. Full bodied. This one seemed to disappear from my glass quickly. Very drinkable and well rounded. I like this one a little better than their Pale Ale, although both are good. Recommended.","1386: Vintage 2010. A: Quarter finger light mocha fades to translucent of the same. Beer is dark, dark brown. No lacing to speak of. S: Extra roasty. Coffee, graham, cocoa, malt, licorice. I can say, however, the hops are still quite present. Piney, resiny. Malt dominant, but still hoppy. T: Roast, cocoa, coffee, lighter hops with earthy feel. Good beer. Not spending much time here, but this is really good. M: thick and syrupy. Like a good beer should be in this genre. D: this is a really good beer. I hate to be a slave to price point, but at nearly $13 for a bomber, I want to be wowed. The beer is good, really really good. If under $9\u002fbomber, I would be all about this one.","1398: Poured from 12 oz can into pint mug: A - Dark golden amber in color. Clear, with nice 2 finger, off-white head. Excellent lacing on glass. S - Citrus,pine, grassy, malty. T - Golden malt at first; quickly followed by citrus and pine. Finishes fairly dry but leaves slight metallic aftertaste. M - Medium. Carbonation is very fine in character. D - As big as this is on flavor, I would have thought the ABV would be more than 6.1%. It's very drinkable; but at @ $14.006 pack it will have to be an occasional treat.","1403: Poured from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass, the beer has a deep red-copper color with a small, thin 1\u002f2\" head that dissipates quickly. The beer is heavily smelling of hops and floral, with a little bit of a smokey background. The hops flavor hits the middle of the tongue, and there is a very short lasting, bitter undertone to it. There is a bitter and at the same time sour aftertaste to the finish, and the bitter portion of that will linger from some time after the beer is gone. It's a heavy IPA that is full of flavor in mouth, but the lingering aftertaste makes this a \"one and done\" for me. I thoroughly enjoy this beer, but one bomber at a time.","1436: Brown in color, somewhere between a porter and a brown ale. Lacking in aroma, but no off stuff. Same with the taste, lacking flavor, complexity, just went with smoothness. No off flavors though, so I can't say this is bad, just unadventurous, especially for Caldera, whom I think is generally underrated. You really have to search to pull anything out of this in terms of the usual chocolate\u002fcoffee flavors, really, the only thing I can tell is that the oats did their job, because this is smooth and unoffensive. Other than that, extremely pedestrian.","1441: Beer pours a dark clear amber color with a nice sturdy head. Aromas are of fresh pine like hops. Not overpowering, but what is there is nice. Flavors are similar to the Ashland Amber, but pumped up a bit. A really crisp tea and malt like character starts out up front. The beer then finishes with a dry bitter hop finish. Mouthfeel is nice, carbonation is good, and the flavors are full. Drinkability is quite good. Session worthy, and a bit more interesting than the Ashland Amber. Pretty good stuff.","1445: Pours very nice dark golden yellow color, nice carbonation, awesome two finger creamy white head, lots and lots of nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, very nice touch of hops, slight citrus, and caramel. The taste is a nice blend of hops\u002fmalts, somce citrus\u002fcaramel. The finish is dry and bitter. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a very nice Pale Ale, recommended.","1449: A - Pours a hazy burnt orange. A billowy 3 finger head. Average lacing. S - Big citrus aroma, caramel, hints of alcohol, dried herbs. T - Citrus hops with some strawberry fruitiness. Some floral spice in the back fades into toasted caramel malt. The malt has a nice sweetness that keeps the hops from taking over everything. The malt seems shy at first but opens up as you go. My first IPA out of a can. Very easy drinking. Good stuff!","1487: A: Poured a nice golden color with good carbonation and a white head S: Floral notes, herbal, light booze T: Caramel, floral, even some biscuity notes at times M: Nice feel, crisp and a good drink D: Very good. Nice taste, very good West Coast take on a APA.","1490: Drank 11\u002f5\u002f11 A: A slightly reddish amber hue, with a head that dissipates quickly and completely. Intriguing simply because it's a different color. S: It smells like an orange chocolate bar. Not what I was expecting at all, but I like it. Not the most exceptional or complex beer I've had, but it's good. T: Again, orange chocolate. Mmm mmm good. Very well balanced, and not a hint of booze. M: Good intermediate body, but nothing special. O: I enjoyed this beer, but I much prefer Caldera's other offerings.","1502: A: Nice amber color with quite an impressive head. About what you'd expect from a good IPA :) S: Very citrusy, lots of grapefruit, lemons, etc.. T: Surprisingly non-bitter. Tastes closer to an APA than an IPA. Nice clean grapefruit with a bit of bitterness on the back end (but not too much). M: Surprisingly light. Carbonation suits it perfect to keep it crisp. O: Overall pretty impressive for a beer I've never heard of. Not too hoppy, not too malty, not too bitter, just does everything pretty well (but not amazingly, admittedly).","1514: A: Pale amber in color, beutifully clear, with a nice white head. S: Sweet caramel, a slight tropical fruit flavor with a hint of pine wood. T: Sweet fruit flavor at first, followed by a nice tropical hops flavor. A bit of a malt in the back, but the hop flavor dominate. Not too bitter, just pleasantly hoppy. M: Medium bodied, slightly chewy, perhaps a little over carb'd D: Very good overall, but I would like to see a little more balance from the malty side. I think the hop profile is dead on.","1527: A golden orange and slightly fizzy brew with a slight fluffy off-white head that constricts slowly instead of outright fading away. A few minuscule dots of lace line the glass. A note of citrus hops is noticed on the nose at first, then a slight caramel sweetness follows up. Melon rind, a squirt of lemon on the tongue, some graininess in the background, and a drop of honey makes for a happy palate. Light to medium bodied with crisp edges. Cohesion is bliss.","1532: Pours crystal clear golden amber, yellowish thick head, chunky head that falls leaving ample lacing. Smells like cidery malt, hops seemed to be subdued, slight fruitiness. Taste is bitter up front, astringent bitterness twang, slight malt but the body is too light to carry the bitterness. Borderline metallic taste, slightest fruitiness. Not the most fantastic but something I can finish, I'd probably buy this again, as the brew isn't too heavy like some IPAs.","1538: A- Good copper amber with a head that lingers. S - Pine, tropical fruit, and caramely malt T - A balanced IPA. The hops give it a good fruity and bitter punch, but the caramel malts really give the most character and are present and linger throughout the whole experience. M - Decent carbonation, not too carbonated, and smooth mouthfeel. O - A highly sessionable and pleasant IPA!","1548: Poured from the can into a Sam Adams \"Perfect\" pint glass. (I don't know why, but beer seems to taste better out of this glass vs a regular pint glass. Call me crazy) A - Nice dark burnt orange color, off-white head, good lacing. S - Pine, grapefruit, mango, nice!!! T - Bitter and piney upfront, with a nice grapefuit and earthy end. Well balanced. Tasty. M - Medium with medium amount of carbonation. D - High. Very tasting and refreshing. Not the hoppiest IPA out there, but well-balanced and tasty. Extremely easy to drink. Great beer. I am really starting to like these Caldera guys!","1564: Dark red color, light beige foam, average. In the smell malt and caramel, not really light. Again malt and caramel in the taste, not bad in the end. Maybe a note of honey in teh back, and a light fruitiness. Average body. In the aftertaste a light bitterness, with the malt and red fruit. Nothing exceptional, but not bad, drinkable beer.","1583: Golden with a dense white head and a massive cascading of carbonation rising to the surface. Clean, sweet, graininess with a nice dose of floral\u002fcitric\u002f herbal hops. Cascades are definitely at work in this brew. Finish is dry and crisp with a perfect amount of bitterness. A more than solid Pale Ale from the folks at Caldera. This one is all West Coast.","1585: I got this one as an extra from one of those awesome West Coast BAs! Thanks! This one pours a nice golden color with an off-whie head. Nice lacing that lasts. Upon popping the top I was hit immediately by a cascate of hoppy smells coming from the can. Smells delicious with the malt to balance things nicely. The taste follows the nose with a nice, crisp finish. In the mouth this one is nice and creamy. This is a highly drinkable beer. It has a nice hoppy dry finish that keeps your mouth wanting more.","1589: Pours a deep gold with a 2 finger head that dissipates to a fine layer, leaving lots of sticky lacing on the glass. Floral hoppy aromas, salty biscuits, and a whiff of ginger. Malty biscuit flavor, then a strong taste of bitter greens\u002fgreen pepper, with a lingering grapefruit finish. Hops are a bit numbing on the tongue. Body is light and the carbonation is enough to give this a moderately creamy mouthfeel. Eminently drinkable beer, for those who like their IPAs with a bitter green hop taste.","1593: The beer pours a nice yellow-orange, with a thick white head. Looks delish. Maybe its my nose, but I don't detect too much - citrusy hops with a pine undergirding. But the taste is exceptional. Wonderfully bright hops and a satisfying malt backbone. But like most west coast ipas, this is not balanced...thankfully. A hops explosion of grapefruit, spice, and pine. Awesome. This is the best IPA i've had in a can...and one of the better ones around PERIOD. Check this one out.","1623: A: Beer poured a light amber color with a orange hue and large 1\" off white head that lasted for sometime. Good lacing on the sides of the glass throughout consumption. S: Citrus, orange pith, pine, and some light caramel notes. T: As with the smell I get grapefruit, orange pith, lots of pine and some light caramel malt balance. This one is pretty hop dominate. M: Medium-light bodied, good carbonation with a drying finish. D: This beer is definately six pack worth and will be one of my camping beers from here on out.","1626: Pours a crisp clear pale gold color with a small head that dissipates rather quickly. Has a bitter hoppy pine and citrus smell. Very pungent for a APA. Bitter bite hits right away and fades to a smooth caramel malty biscuity flavor. Not very complex, but good tastes none the less. A very light smooth beer. Very sessionable could def hammer a few of these back.","1627: HOPS! If you like a hoppy beer, this is for you. Pours a golden brown with a nice foamy head. Complex flavors keep you interested with citrus and fruity notes. Just enough maltiness to keep the hops from being completely overwhelming. Aroma is strong with fruity citrus notes as well.","1649: A: Poured a hazy amber color with a nice white cap S: Faded piney hops, caramel T: Caramel and faded hops battle for dominance while the metallic and old Earthy notes fight for second place. Bad. M: Medium to full body and not one I would recommend hiolding on your palate O: Poor IPA, drainpoured after two sips","1658: First micro brew for me in a can. Cool logo but with no freshness date. It pours a amber color with a nice sea foam head. The smell is strong of hops. The taste hits you with a dry hop appeal with a huge hop profile. It leaves a stinging pleasant aftertaste as it journeys down the throat. I really like the uniqueness of the this American IPA profile.","1666: 22oz bottle A- Pours a hazy amber color with an off-white head with decent retention and lacing. S- The aroma is sweet malt and some citrus notes from the centennial hops as well. The aroma is good, but a little more subdued than I was expecting. T- The taste like the aroma is smooth and malty up front with the hops coming in and lingering well into the finish. M- The mouthfeel is light bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. D- Overall, I enjoyed Hopportunity Knocks but I isn't a beer I would likely seek out again. Worth a try.","1668: On tap tonight at the Horse Brass. Nice looking orangy amber ale with a tiny white head that lasts no time, some lace left. Aroma is pleasant but nothing special ..of hops and malts with a touch or orange peel zest. The taste was exhilarating to start with the hops blending well with the orange peel falavours but after a while it bacame dullish,but themalts held throughout. Mouthfeel was rather on the thin side and average for style This is a nice beer but for once I think this would be better served quite chilled.","1679: Okay, pilseners aren't that hard to make, but being able to match what I drank in Germany? Well, that's a tall order. With that said, this reminded me of the beers I drank in Germany, when I favored the crisp, clean taste of a cold pilsener. The color is straw yellow and crystal-clear. The smell is light and floral, and the taste is crisp, malty-sweet and lightly hopped. In addition, the hops hit you then disappear. The mouthfeel is light, as a pilsener should be. Overall, an exceptional beer!","1682: poured into a tulip from a can with a two finger head and a deep copperish golden color with a slight reddish hue. smells like a slight twinge of alcohol and a floral yet citrusy hop aroma. and a sugary sweet malt backbone. Taste is bitterup front with a citrusy tongue with a sweet malt finish. relly quite impresive for my first craft beer from a can. super complex and tasty as hell. Mouth is suprisingly clean with a bite in the front. drinks moderately and really suprised me. For the cost I can't say it's worth it. 14.99 a six pack is steep for this one but it is a damn fine beer.","1693: 12oz can courtesy of Reino poured into a pint glass. Pours a clear light golden with a decent creamy white head that hung on as a cap for a while leaving good lacing. The aroma is very light with lots of lemony hops up front and a bit of bready malts as well. The flavor had the light citrus up front with the malts in the middle before giving way to some faint pine hop bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated and lighter than most pale ales. This is a very drinkable pale that doesn't have too much differentiation but is still tasty.","1697: appearance - light amber color, just a little darker than I expected from the nose, big frothy head. Smell - very nice hop, pine, some fruit taste - nice hoppy grapefruite taste, dry finish mouthfeel - very even, not too thin, not too chewy for a single ipa overall - solid, I doubt I will pay $12.99 again for this brew and it probably factored into my rating","1707: Aroma is absolutely heavenly - smoky with firm tones of quality coffee, molasses and sweet chocolate and a hint of licorice. It pours a deep, rich, warm opaque sable with a thick dark tan head that leaves some good lacing. Mouth filling flavor has a decided mocha core, quality coffee and chocolate plus licorice, molasses and even a bit of hoppy bitterness. Smooth flavor has a firm and biting fizz, and it leaves a smoky, slightly bitter, tingly finish. If ever you are in Oregon, grab a bottle - or better yet, grab two or three so you have something to trade.","1709: Exceptionally pale yellow with vigorous carbonation, a light white head, fogged body, and full abstract lace. This simple session lager has a sustained head, a light appealing aroma, and enough Saaz to keep your feet tapping. Could use a catchier name though. Served on tap at the Siskiyou Pub, Ashland, OR.","1717: 12oz bottle into pint glass. Pours a slightly hazy deep gold color with off-white head. Nose gives off notes of mango and grassiness with honey maltiness. Taste is mellow and spicy with notes of date and dried plums. Grassy and green hop presence with smooth bitterness. Moderate carbonation with a dry finish and lingering bitterness. Overall a nice pale ale that has a well-rounded (albeit bitter) flavor profile. Not as full-bodied as others, but good nonetheless.","1729: Orangeish with a peach head. Smell was hoppy. Taste was hoppy, not alot else going on. Not exciting but not boring either. It was easy to swallow but not alot else. Its something I could drink a few of. Good if you want a session beer but don't want a strong flavor.","1730: Interesting beer...not too sure how I feel about this. Looks good enough...cloudy orange with a decent white head. Malty, very floral smell. Creamy, light caramel scent. Light hops. Weird, floraly hop taste. Sour-ish after taste. Weird, bready character. Definitely can taste the rose, but its all muddled. Nothing really stands out. Slightly flat, not horrible. I think this would be better as a pint or a six pack, not a bomber.","1738: More of a 'dry' than a lager, tasted at the 2002 Oregon Brewers Festival. Orange color, orange flavor in nose. Light malts and fairly aggressively hopped; yet it is not very bitter. Interesting taste, complex and subtle. Light yet flavorful. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Nice beer. Would be a great beer to sip during a hot summer day.","1752: Golden amber body with a solid finger of thick white head. Rather light for a Pale. Nose is light hops, grassy but tart. Flavor is lightly sweet, a moderate foundation of malt that balances the hops. Wonderful hops, tart C hops, but not overdone. A well balanced brew that is flavorful, yet still very quenching. Mouthfeel is tart and tangy. Drinkability is great! A very tasty and easily drinkable Pale. Bring me more!","1753: Pours out a pale straw like color with a bubbly 2 finger deep white head. Smells of light flowery Cascade hoppiness, pine, spruce, tropical. Flavor is soft bisquity maltiness, piney hops, faint caramel sweetness, earthy tone, nicely balanced. Crisp, clean, light to medium bodied, lingering bitterness. Highly drinkable. excellent summer session brew. Should be a campsite\u002fcooler standard.","1759: Standard lighter yellow pale ale here, good foamy head. Nice soft floral hop arrangement, if you like caldera, you'll be all good here. Plenty of taste in a pale, relative hefty amount of hops for style, light, ever so light toasting of the malt allows the hops to shine without making them exist in a ridiculous amount. Bitterness is sturdy, minty and metallic, but not a distraction or covering up the more delicate aspect of the beer, would say it leans to the grapefruit side of hop taste, cascade, chinook seem to be all over this one.","1764: Poured a deep copper hue with a one and a half finger foamy white head. There was good retention and lacing. The smell featured a full cereal grain, caramel and a citric hop. The taste was mainly hop driven with a grain full malt behind. Citus and pine dominated. Theouthfeel was typical of the style with a very dry finish. Overall a tasty hop driven west coast ale.","1776: Pours a clear, amber color. 1\u002f2 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of strong hops and slight earthy malt. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of strong hops, some sweet malt, and some earthy malt. Overall, a very tasty IPA and by far the best beer I've ever had from a can. This was practically mind blowing for me to really enjoy a canned beer. Definitely worth a try!","1789: Poured from a can into a a Chouffe Flute A-Very deep nice amber\u002fdark copper laces thick and sticky down the glass, very sexy looking in the glass. S-very floral bitter hop smell. Grapefruit notes very citrusy. T-Much like the nose great bitterness in the front middle and back. Has a nice sweet malt quality in the middle, almost like a sweeter orange flavor very subtle but adds alot. M-Medium body near perfect on the carbonation. D-Only reason this is not a 5 is the price everything else about this beer on this section is flawless.","1801: Purchased in Portland during my spring break Pacific Northwest trip, the only bottle offering I've had from Caldera. Poured is a orange hued color. This IPA tastes maltier than the ones I used to have. Drinking at near room temperature made this even maltier-tasting, which isn't necessarily bad, but to me it tastes more like an amber than an IPA. It's a good beer but not outstanding.","1831: A-Pours an orange\u002famber color with a dense, pillowy, white, one finger head. S-Grapefruit, pine and mango with some pineapple and light carmale notes. T-Bitter pine, pineapple, some grapefruit with light malt and a dry bitter finish. M-Pretty crisp and dry in the mouthfeel with medium body and pirckly, but low carbonation. D-Really nice IPA. It has most of the things that I look for in an IPA: some malt backbone, a nice bitter hop burst and a great fragrant nose.","1835: Attractive amber in the tulip glass with very nice head and lacing. Modest aroma. Initial taste is promising. A touch of sweet malt but mostly it's the heavy hand of hops. Sharp and acidic on the palate. Some aromatics with a flowery touch, but mostly just bitter. Aftertaste goes on and on. Unrelieved bitterness with not much interest to go with it. Not very drinkable. I am trying to find something good to say about this beer, since it's clean and well made. But for IPA lovers, it's definitely in the zone.","1849: Complex enjoyable smoked. Tasty rich malt,caramel, woody,spicey, and balanced. Leans a tad to sweetness rather than bitterness. The smoke is significant in the aroma but not overwhelming. Above average mouthfeel. Yellow coloured body. Most drinkable.Thanks Augustgarage.","1850: A: pours amber orange with a decent finger of off white head. S: grapefruit and light pine, and floral hop. There is some malt sweetness in the background. T: a nice tounge coating hop, that is piny, a citrus cross between grapefruit and orange. Malt is light but nicely sweet. M: coating hop, though the malt is light in the mouth, good carbonation. O: canned beer is really starting to grow on me, and leaves me impressed enough to try calderas other offerings","1855: Good IPA and in a can!!! Pours a light amber\u002fgolden clear color with a medium sized frothy white head. Average retention and thick rings of lacing. Smell includes piney and citrus hops. Prominent and good. Tastes good as well. Piney and citrus hops and enough malt to be able to say balanced. The hops win out and the beer is still bitter but also smooth, crisp and easy to drink. Mouthfeel is crisp and starts out a bit thin. But like many IPAs, the hops coat the tongue and make the beer appear more rich. Drinkability is good. Good tasting, balanced and smooth.","1859: Thanks to bman1113vr for sharing this bottle. The beer pours a clear brown color with a tan head. The aroma is heavy on the toffee and not too much else. The flavor is toffee, leather, tobacco, wood and dark fruit. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A decent beer but nothing too exciting.","1871: Poured from the can a clear golden hue with two fingers of bright white head. Good lacing all around. Aroma is slightly sour and malty much like a pilsner. A slight whiff of sulfur and vegetables as well. The taste has a bitter edge along with malt and biscuit. Lighter bodied, dry, and moderately carbonated. Pretty drinkable, but this is a fairly decent pale ale that sits in the middle of the pack.","1893: Smell is light, almost non-existent, must be trapped in the dark amber. Very light head tops a thin effervescent surface. Taste is belgian yet bitter, with very little of the promised oranges. I'm getting a lot of roast out of this, which normally would be a compliment but it just doesn't fit what I was expecting. Aside from the bitter notes the beer is pretty good, it's almost like a belgian strong dark coffee stout ale.","1905: Clear dark amber with a good three finger white head. Plentiful lacings. Aroma is fruity citrus hops with a bit of leather. Taste is full deep leathery bitter hops with the correct amount of malts. The label describes \"centennial hops\" as the mainstay of all that bitterness. Mouthfeel is just right, and drinkability is very good for this style. Kudos to Caldera for daring to bottle a limited production beer. Their normal regimen is cans. Cool label. Give the fellows from the \"State of Jefferson\" a big thumbs up! Keep it coming Caldera!","1910: Amber brown in color with very little head but a nice ring. Nicely carbonated. Smells like a camp fire, malts have a good sweet character with an abundance of smoke. Taste is quite good with smokiness being pungent but not overwelming. A sweet tasting bock with smokiness coming through around mid drink with a smooth mellow finish. A good warming smoky beer.","1919: Appearance - Pours a pale golden color with about a finger of quickly dissipating head that leaves little lacing on the edges of the glass. Smell - Light hops, grainy malts, breadyness. Taste - Taste is similar to the nose with a hint of caramel\u002fhoney. Nothing really stands out to me as special, but then again what do you expect with the description on the side of this. Mouthfeel - Light bodied, prickly carbonation. Drinkability - Quite drinkable to be honest, however as someone else stated, might as well buy some PBR's rather than spend money on this.","1933: A- is cloudy and light glassy goldeness S- smell of light winter pine needles and small delicate floral hints T- the taste is light and easy to drink, very winter like in the beginning. Reminds me of being in a forest and then at the end your hit with small hints of flower flavor. M- easy to the tounge and flows with 2 waves of flavor. Both are easy and satisfying. O- this is a very unique beer and I would recommend it to any one for a very different drinking experience. It easy and I would drink this beer in the winter or spring. Its very light and still has a pretty high alcohol%.","1940: Reddish amber with good clarity. Modest head that leaves light lacing. Pretty color, but fairly unusual for an IPA. Pleasant nose but more malty than hoppy - graham cracker maybe? Herbal hop character with moderate lingering bitterness. A bit metallic. Medium bodied. A bit juicy but metallic bitterness builds to dominate the impression.","870: Great to see this Oregon brewery now in my area.Poured a deep hazed burnt orange with a tight formed slight off white crown that held well,big citric aromas with a bit of pine resin,a biscuit dough aroma lends a little maltiness to the mix.Deep grapefruit rind flavors really stand out,this is a true American ipa with its hop forward profile,a lightly sweet biscuit dough malt base stands up well to the big hop presence.A solid beer,to me what an American ipa should be.","82: From a can an aggressive pour into a chalice. Looks nice. Dark golden clear color with a decent head. Lace layers nicely on the side of the glass. Aroma is very pleasing building anticipation and expectations. The taste isn't quite there however. The citrus is there - to a fault. A little too bitter with an unpleasing aftertaste. It's good, just not quite ready for the big time. With all the great beers Oregon has to offer the competition is too tough to rate this beer among the best. If they smooth out the edges with a little balance this can be a great beer.","127: Had this on tap at the recently opened Hawthorne Hophouse. Hadn't been there before. I'll review it soon. They served this one in a 12oz. tulip. A: This beer has a dark brown reddish look that had a pretty tan looking head. S: It smells quite intense. A resin malty scent that carries with it some alcohol. T: This beer tastes like resiny caramel. It is a little sweet and has a long drawn out flavor. M: It dries out your mouth with the lingering dry aftershock. Not a very carbonated beer. Quite a bit of body for even this color. D: I could have a few of these. Definately an intense strong ale, but I'll admit I'm a sucker for Caldera.","128: One of the best IPAs from Oregon (which is saying a lot). $2 for a 12-oz. can at Full Throttle Bottle in south Seattle--and worth every penny. Great head on this rosy-orange colored beer. It lets off a strong and unmistakable lychee aroma, which I've smelled on all three separate occasions I've tasted it so far. Flavor has the same lychee up front, with piney\u002fresiny hops backing it up. Carbonation is good and the finish is pleasantly bitter that doesn't linger over-long. All in all, one great IPA and probably the best thing I've ever drunk out of a can.","201: Great pale ale. Really sticks out among this blahh category. Very well balanced and refreshing. Nice hop aroma and taste but finish is well balanced. Hops and malt are just the right combo. Just what a pale ale is supposed to be. Very surprised by this brewery I'd never heard of.","312: This bottle was hand delivered from my brother who lives in Portland, OR. The beers pours a deep burnt orange color with a small white head. Very nice lacing on the glass. The dominant smell is of sweet caramel. Taste is also sweet caramel with a strong earthly, almost dirty, hop finish that hangs! A decent beer, but much more malty than I would expect from a beer called Hopportunity Knocks.","339: appearance - highly carbonated, boastful head (2-3 in), transparent golden amber smell - resinous hops (simcoe?) taste - highly resinous, pine, pronounced hop flavor, some sweet malts to balance it out (very subtle though) mouthfeel - high carbonation, medium body, slightly dry finish drinkability - nice big resinous hop profile, true oregon\u002fwest coast ipa, bordering on a session beer if you can handle the hops!","505: I had this very nice IPA on-tap at Brewer's Haven in Boise, Idaho after I had completed a little beer shopping. Poured amber with a nice head and great lacing. Smells very fruity with candied orange peel and grapefruit pith. The taste is very full, with bitter hops, breadiness. Sharp pine and earth in the hop profile. A little chewy in the mouth, but ovarall this is dry, bitter, and delicious.","833: Big thanks to Bobby8405 for the share A - Pours a hazy amber-copper hue, with a rocky off-white head. S - Some citrus-y and evergreen hop aroma is available, but it is pretty tame. T - The flavor is much more potent than the aroma. There is a very classic West Coast dankness that is melded at first with the rich malt, but then separates itself and stands apart, with great herbal and leafy hop flavors lingering intensely on the finish. M - IPA. Good. D - Not the best of the West, but pretty good.","839: My first beer from this brew...and what a goodie! Over a finger of off-white head lingers over a translucent amber. The head lives a good amount of sticky lacing all over the glass. Aromas of floral and herbal hops with a sweet but bready maltiness as a distance backbone. Earthy notes in both the aroma and taste. Tons of bitter residuals linger on the palate, thanks in part to a medium mouthfeel. This is a delicious IPA, and I look forward to grabbing more cans from this brewery!","856: 12oz can $2. I did not care for this beer. It looked good, orange, pale, good lace, decent head. It smelled kind of weak but not bad. It tasted like stale iced tea and I did not care for that flavor one bit. The IPA I had from this brewer was much better than this. For my money I'd stick with Full Sail Pale Ale for a couple dollars less.","1203: I had the opportunity to try this wonderful beer on tap at the Rogue Brewery sponsored Bones and Brew Backyard BBQ this weekend in Portland, Oregon's Pearl District. Thirty delicious beers on tap and this was the first I tried (hey, I'm a Southern Oregon man, plus my girlfriend wanted something a little fruity). The orange flavor was vibrant and quite simply amazing. Sweet, but not too sweet, and not overly bitter. The hops and orange flavor played very well together. I would love to try it once again, if I can find it.","1320: I had this on tap last in August of 2009 at Bailey's Taproom in Portland, Oregon. The colour was a very dark brown with a garnet base and a thin tan head. The aroma was full of coffee, roasted malt and chocolate. On the palate, there was light CO2, day old coffee, some dark chocolate and more roasted malt.","1321: Tap handle red \"Dry Hop Orange\" but alas, here we go. Warm hoppy sack of Mt. Hood on the nose. Citrus and Oranges rise up to the nearly caustic bitterness. Thinish mouthfeel, but damned drinkable. Amazing blend of malt and hop gives this a shockingly Orange Juice like flavor. I was convinced this was a fruit\u002fvegetable beer, and my notes end with \"blows ApriHop out of the water\". Hey, it was a long night of beer tasting ... still this was one tasty brew to quaff through the hot Portland summer night.","1363: This was at the newer Caldera Tap House in Ashland (Rogue Brewery's old, original spot....) It was a little dark on the patio outside, but it certainly had an orange glow and appropriate lacing. Aroma had lavender, clementine, grapefruit pith, scented geranium and thai basil exploding from the glass. Delightfully potent hops without the poison-like bitterness or tannin. Don't get me wrong, I like big beers, but drinkability for a pitcher with friends is crucial and this fit the bill.","1409: Served in dining room of Crater Lake Lodge, Crater Lake National Park, OR, in 12 ounce pilsner glass. Dark amber color with one finger head. Initial hop aroma pronounced. Slight lemon tang gave way to pronounced hop finish. Very drinkable, would make a good session beer. A pity I was not able to try CBC's IPA this trip. As good as the Amber was, the IPA would have been outstanding.","1433: Picked up a 6-pack at State Line in Maryland. Poured a golden amber with a good white head. This beer reminds me of Dale's Pale Ale, and not because of the can. There's a big punch of citrus and pine hops that's met (more so here than with Dale's) by a hit of caramel malt. Very drinkable and a tasty, more balanced IPA.","1585: I got this one as an extra from one of those awesome West Coast BAs! Thanks! This one pours a nice golden color with an off-whie head. Nice lacing that lasts. Upon popping the top I was hit immediately by a cascate of hoppy smells coming from the can. Smells delicious with the malt to balance things nicely. The taste follows the nose with a nice, crisp finish. In the mouth this one is nice and creamy. This is a highly drinkable beer. It has a nice hoppy dry finish that keeps your mouth wanting more.","1608: Pilot Rock is brown with ruby highlights and sports a thin head with no lace. It started with a nice roasted aroma and flavor. But these initial selling points lacked sustain. Most dimensions are otherwise customary with a slightly thin body. Served on tap at the Siskiyou Pub, Ashland, OR.","1657: 12 oz. can, these guys finally showed up in the Southland, another Oregon brewer to try out, A: Pours a dark yellow, with a finger of white head, solid lace. S: Earthy hops, one-dimensional. Cascades. T: Upfront cedar-box and tobacco in the hops, quite bitter and earthy initially. Malt character is very light. Notes of pine oil late. M: A bit too light-bodied, soft carbonation. D: My uncle used to live in Ashland, so I've been wanting to try the Caldera beers for sometimes. The Pale was OK, the hop flavours weren't really to my liking, time to move on.","1658: First micro brew for me in a can. Cool logo but with no freshness date. It pours a amber color with a nice sea foam head. The smell is strong of hops. The taste hits you with a dry hop appeal with a huge hop profile. It leaves a stinging pleasant aftertaste as it journeys down the throat. I really like the uniqueness of the this American IPA profile.","1738: More of a 'dry' than a lager, tasted at the 2002 Oregon Brewers Festival. Orange color, orange flavor in nose. Light malts and fairly aggressively hopped; yet it is not very bitter. Interesting taste, complex and subtle. Light yet flavorful. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Nice beer. Would be a great beer to sip during a hot summer day.","1801: Purchased in Portland during my spring break Pacific Northwest trip, the only bottle offering I've had from Caldera. Poured is a orange hued color. This IPA tastes maltier than the ones I used to have. Drinking at near room temperature made this even maltier-tasting, which isn't necessarily bad, but to me it tastes more like an amber than an IPA. It's a good beer but not outstanding.","1816: This has recently hit the NC market...in reading reviews I' puzzled at the reviews. This is an AWESOME IPA...simply awesome. Appearance is great, cloudy with a very decent 2\" head. Smell is fresh hops and malt...more hops than malt. Taste is mostly all grapefruit hops...I love it. Right next to G'Night (Gordon) as the best beer from a can...I gave my son a can and even his collage buddies who don't like IPA's said it was amazing. The price point is a little high ($13 for a sixer) in NC but I love this brew.","1819: A friend of mine brought this beer for me from a trip to Oregon. It poured a hazy amber orange and produced a about one finger high, white bubbly head. It dissipates fast and leaves good lacing. The smell is very intense flowery hops, with a nice combination of orange, peach and citrus. The taste is just like the smell announced. Fruity citrus flavors up front, great hop character in the middle and a bittersweet finish, where some carefully measured orange balances a slight bitter end. Great beer and something I would love to try on tap.","872: one word WOW! this has to be one of the hoppiest beers I've ever had, the hop profile is well preseved inside its 12 oz can. Pours a warm copper color with a huge floral aroma of hops. I would say the freshness of the hops makes it almost over hopped and hard to drink. But, it is a must for any hop head to try. Not your average canned beer...try one you love it or hate it...","127: Had this on tap at the recently opened Hawthorne Hophouse. Hadn't been there before. I'll review it soon. They served this one in a 12oz. tulip. A: This beer has a dark brown reddish look that had a pretty tan looking head. S: It smells quite intense.

Nice hop aroma and taste but finish is well balanced. Hops and malt are just the right combo. Just what a pale ale is supposed to be. Very surprised by this brewery I'd never heard of.","549: Suprised by the hoppy taste from this can. Consumed at a bar called the Tin Can in St. Louis. Citrus notes in the initial smell gives way to a hoppy and well carbonated first drink. I also pick up a little banana aroma. I drank this brew straight from the can which probably didn't assist the experience but it us definitely a drinkable ipa. As previously stated it is quite hoppy for a can which is refreshing. I am not able to get this at home so I am glad that I tried it.","765: I didn't know what to expect from this brew when I ordered it up. I think the thing to keep in mind is this: if you are not a hop-head but love the flavor of the hop smell, this is the one for you! When I took the first sip, I realized that what this should have been called is \"hopjuice\". The taste is the supreme incarnation of Cascade hop aroma stripped off of the bitterness. I thought it was wonderful, although I knocked it down because the underlying beer characteristic did not push through as much as I would have liked. Being a NW interpretation of Red, however, the balance stood on its own very well. Terrific and recommended if you can get it.","856: 12oz can $2. I did not care for this beer. It looked good, orange, pale, good lace, decent head. It smelled kind of weak but not bad. It tasted like stale iced tea and I did not care for that flavor one bit. The IPA I had from this brewer was much better than this. For my money I'd stick with Full Sail Pale Ale for a couple dollars less.","911: My main man woodychandler comes through with yet another canned beer for me to try. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a orange\u002fbrownish color with a 1\u002f2 inch head. Smell is very hoppy, not much else. Taste is also all hops, dry and bitter, not much else coming through. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer.","1240: A: Pours to a frothey tan head with a deep and beautiful copper body. Excellent lacing. S: Slight, hoppy, piney aroma. T: Citrusy with piney hops. Crisp and not real bitter but it does have a slight bite with lasting flavor. The hops definitely comes through. A nice IPA that doesn't knock you over. Typically what an IPA is suppose to be. M: Lightly carbonated, smooth and thin. Not watery or oily. D: Refreshing and while not a session beer, you can easily enjoy a couple of these without any problems. One of the better canned micro-brews that I have tried.","1334: Wierd tasting IPA, thrown in a trade. Starts OK, and then residual odd hop flavours. Medium yellow body, a quarter inch of white foam. A little hop aromas. Not skunky, but just another AMerican IPA to me, with moe astringency than balance. A bit aggressive carbonation.","1403: Poured from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass, the beer has a deep red-copper color with a small, thin 1\u002f2\" head that dissipates quickly. The beer is heavily smelling of hops and floral, with a little bit of a smokey background. The hops flavor hits the middle of the tongue, and there is a very short lasting, bitter undertone to it. There is a bitter and at the same time sour aftertaste to the finish, and the bitter portion of that will linger from some time after the beer is gone. It's a heavy IPA that is full of flavor in mouth, but the lingering aftertaste makes this a \"one and done\" for me. I thoroughly enjoy this beer, but one bomber at a time.","1627: HOPS! If you like a hoppy beer, this is for you. Pours a golden brown with a nice foamy head. Complex flavors keep you interested with citrus and fruity notes. Just enough maltiness to keep the hops from being completely overwhelming. Aroma is strong with fruity citrus notes as well.","1658: First micro brew for me in a can. Cool logo but with no freshness date. It pours a amber color with a nice sea foam head. The smell is strong of hops. The taste hits you with a dry hop appeal with a huge hop profile. It leaves a stinging pleasant aftertaste as it journeys down the throat. I really like the uniqueness of the this American IPA profile.","1759: Standard lighter yellow pale ale here, good foamy head. Nice soft floral hop arrangement, if you like caldera, you'll be all good here. Plenty of taste in a pale, relative hefty amount of hops for style, light, ever so light toasting of the malt allows the hops to shine without making them exist in a ridiculous amount. Bitterness is sturdy, minty and metallic, but not a distraction or covering up the more delicate aspect of the beer, would say it leans to the grapefruit side of hop taste, cascade, chinook seem to be all over this one.","1816: This has recently hit the NC market...in reading reviews I' puzzled at the reviews. This is an AWESOME IPA...simply awesome. Appearance is great, cloudy with a very decent 2\" head. Smell is fresh hops and malt...more hops than malt. Taste is mostly all grapefruit hops...I love it.

The price point is a little high ($13 for a sixer) in NC but I love this brew.","1885: This is a great beer in the canned beer arena. Had no option but to drink this straight from the can so I can't comment on appearance. Had a nice scent of bitter citrus and pine. Hops contribute a moderate bitterness consisting of both grapefruit and pine flavors, on top of a lightly sweet pale malt backbone.. Mouthfeel was crisp and pleasing with generous carbonation. Had a couple of these on a hike and found them to be great for the occasion.","1907: Poured into an imperial nonic a clear copper with a great one finger sticky white head that nver really leaves,a frothy mass is there during the whole duration of the glass.Big caramel malt in the nose with subdued citric hops,a little hop oomph and it would be great.Citric and herbal hops play against a big caramel\u002fbiscuit malt base with neither getting the upper heand really.There is a little lightly roasted nuttiness in the malt profile as well.A beer thats oh so close to being stellar,just bump up the hop profile and there you go,as is its pretty good.","928: I have been thinking of picking up a bottle of this for a while pours a deep deep red, glowing, standing out a lot smell of slight smoke, peat, a bit of cherry, bbq Taste is mostly peated malt smoke, a lot of it...i was expecting more smokey, not peated. still a bit of darker, roasted fruits, a bit of burnt sugar, some peanut but overall makes it pretty unique. Mouthfeel is really smooth, lower carbed tickles the tongue just right, goes down well Overall its not bad, but as far as a rauch, feels like to much of that peated taste, dont know if I would pick it amongst other smoked beers.","244: This is my first rauchbier. Pours a burnt amber. Good head. Holy smoked meat! This has huge beef jerky on the nose. Salty smoked meat goodness. Tastes about the same as it the nose. Wood, smoked meat, cured meat, soy sauce. This is delicious for the first 6-8oz, then it gets to be a little much. I imagine after having this a few times, you appreciate the flavors more. Maybe I should've picked a tamer rauchbier to be my first","272: Poured into a 1\u002f2 liter stein a deep rich amber\u002fbronze with a fluffy one finger head that took its time fading.Sweet smoke,brown,sugar,a bit of alcohol in the nose,mellow and sweetish,I found it appetizing.Cherry wood sweetness and light peppery spice in the nose,its gentle sweet smoke instead of in your face,mellow but assertive enough.A real nice smoked bock beer,I will grab a few of these this fall while eating alot of smoked meat off my smoker.","342: Poured a slightly cloudy deep amber\u002fred color with a thin soap ring of head. The smell is amazing, big bacony smoked pork Rauch goodness. The taste follows the flavors nicely with a big smoked malt flavor with a nice bit of underlying sweetness, very pork like and very flavorful. Has a nice light bitterness in the finish that helps even it out very well. The mouthfeel is very slick and oily. Great Rauchbier!","586: Pours out a little thin looking weak ice tea color with two fingers of slightly off-white suds and lots of lacing. Smell is strong citrus and grapefruit rind. This is a great smelling beer. Taste is piney and grapefruity with slight sugar. Mouthfeel is very clean for such a big hop brew. Not sticky at all. Very quaffable. Overall I would have to give this a 4 even though it's really in the 4.12 range. Only reason not to give it a 4.5 is the cost of this stuff. 16 dollars in Ky.","662: Big thanks to N2168 for knocking this off my wants. Poured into a stone nonic and shared with my buddy Ryan. This was quite delicious. The pour made it seem a little lacking in carbonation, and while indeed it was light in carbonation I think it would have been awkward if it had been heavier considering the taste profile. This beer does such a good job of hitting the sweet and savory side of smoke. Nice big campfire smoke smell and taste without any roughness to it, with a nice smoked bacon savory sweetness. This is easy to drink and just downright delicious, would love to have a keg of this by my desk.","741: I got this beer from Tilley4. Thanks Jason! 12oz can served in a standard pint glass. L - slightly hazed copper color with a bone white head that left trails of lacing. S - citrus rind and a slab of butter rolled in dirt. T - bitter citrus rind upfront with some buttery notes before getting dry and tart on the finish. F - medium bodied with a biting feel and smooth carbonation. D - goes down quick and easy.","805: Sampled 10\u002f30\u002f11 - Transferring the notes. A ruby pour with a half finger, off white head. Opaque. Smells like bacon it's so smoky. Very much a wood smoked scent, great on an autumn night. The flavor is full but not overbearing, smoky with a hint of sweetness. I dig this a lot, will seek out other rauchbiers for some comparison.","855: picked up a six-pack because I have been hearing good things about this beer. A- dont know much since I drank it out of the can. T- Wow this stuff is great! the pine taste and citrus just explode in your mouth at the first drink. Unfortunately only one store carries this in my area and it is a bit of a trip but well worth it for one of the best beers out of a can you ever had.","1031: Tapped this open and a fruity piney smell, Cloudy golden orange color when poured in a pint glass. Nice foaming thick head. Big and hoppy, yet smooth as butter. Minimal hop after taste (I like this, so was a liittle disappointed with the lack there of there) However, a delicious beer. Would drink it anytime!! I bet on draft it is a delight!","1113: Pours dark amber with a short white fizzy head that fades fast. Aroma is BBQ and smoked pork, some sweet malt and a touch of chocolate. Flavor starts out like a smoked pork sandwhich, nice smooth lagered finish. Smoke and sweet malt stick in the mouth something fierce. A beer that performs as advertised, smoke meat and lager all in one, not really a style I want more than one of but still tasty.","1134: Pours a mahogany color, rich, with a tan head. a finger, didn't stick around. Holy smokes! This is one of the most smokiest beer I've ever had! BUT. It's balance and not one sided. Smoke, cured bacon, rich caramel malts. More smoke. Ok, maybe it one sided, but it's heavenly. Rich caramel malts and salty cured bacon strips. Bacon lover right here, so, I don't feel the need to go on. Lighter, but medium in body. feels fine. Nothing tremendous. Aroma and flavor alone are mouthwatering. Bravo. More please!!!","1145: Was pretty excited to see some limited 22's from Caldera down this way. Interesting art work on the bottle. A-ruby, brown almost a dark mahogany, small half finger head and translucent S-Orange, cherry and chocolate-Terry Chocolate Orange upfront, a faint grassy smell in the end T- light malts and belgian yeast. light orange and cherries with a slight bitterness on the end M-watery, light carbonation, not much body to it D-Overall, the taste was interesting but light, I wish it tasted as good as the smell was. There was not much body to this one for being a strong dark Belgian.","1277: Overall a really nice and interesting beer. I saw this on the shelf and hadn't tried anything yet from this brewery but looked interesting. Figured I would try it. It was really a nice beer. It definitely had a lot of smoky and meaty flavor to it! Very interesting and nice beer overall, I would drink it again.","1683: A - Poured out of a bottle into a tulip glass. Lots of bubbles, almost transparent, rust-red color. No head. S - Smoky, smoke smoke. Smells like right after I get the BBQ going but before I throw any meat on the grill. I also get a green olive scent at the beginning. T - Smoke. Burnt wood. Sweet malt at the end. No bitterness at all. I think the smoke mellows out the intense malt sweetness that usually accompanies a bock. M - Very crisp, it is a lager after all. D - A good beer. There are not too many smoked beers made, so for that reason alone I tried it. Well worth it, though it was not my favorite smoked beer.","1849: Complex enjoyable smoked. Tasty rich malt,caramel, woody,spicey, and balanced. Leans a tad to sweetness rather than bitterness. The smoke is significant in the aroma but not overwhelming. Above average mouthfeel. Yellow coloured body. Most drinkable.Thanks Augustgarage.","1859: Thanks to bman1113vr for sharing this bottle. The beer pours a clear brown color with a tan head. The aroma is heavy on the toffee and not too much else. The flavor is toffee, leather, tobacco, wood and dark fruit. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A decent beer but nothing too exciting.","1893: Smell is light, almost non-existent, must be trapped in the dark amber. Very light head tops a thin effervescent surface. Taste is belgian yet bitter, with very little of the promised oranges. I'm getting a lot of roast out of this, which normally would be a compliment but it just doesn't fit what I was expecting. Aside from the bitter notes the beer is pretty good, it's almost like a belgian strong dark coffee stout ale.","942: Good pale ale. Out of a can is a novelty. Made this and a few others a great choice for craft beer golfing fare. Tastes great. Lots of grapefruit and pine notes, but it's the stoutish chocolate backbone that makes this a real winner. Far more earthy than some other, more popular pale's out of bottles nonetheless. Very tasty. Will definately revisit. Drawbacks... not many... a little sour in the finish when the choco and malt dissapates.... could also be the can talking here... but regardless this is one dam^ fine pale ale. a little pricey around here at 10.99\u002fsix doesn't help either... sure it's less near the source.... will take it for another round soon.","201: Great pale ale. Really sticks out among this blahh category. Very well balanced and refreshing. Nice hop aroma and taste but finish is well balanced. Hops and malt are just the right combo. Just what a pale ale is supposed to be. Very surprised by this brewery I'd never heard of.","856: 12oz can $2. I did not care for this beer. It looked good, orange, pale, good lace, decent head. It smelled kind of weak but not bad. It tasted like stale iced tea and I did not care for that flavor one bit. The IPA I had from this brewer was much better than this. For my money I'd stick with Full Sail Pale Ale for a couple dollars less.","1736: Delicious full bodied stout with all the trimmings. Leather, wood, tobacco, sugary fruit. The nice thing about Old Growth is that you can savor the \"mature\" end of the taste spectrum without having to be knocked out by a 12%+ abv. Caldera's move into the richer end of the spectrum is exciting, looking forward to their future beers ! This beer is a great seasonal, not trying to dethrone abyss, but a great addition to the fall\u002fwinter lineup.","1885: This is a great beer in the canned beer arena. Had no option but to drink this straight from the can so I can't comment on appearance. Had a nice scent of bitter citrus and pine.

Had a couple of these on a hike and found them to be great for the occasion.","1089: Comes out of the tap an opaque deep sable with a minimal head, but the latter may be an artifact of te pour. Smoky aroma has tones of molasses and high-quality coffee. Absolutely delicious flavor has roast coffee, chocolate and molasses components and is just slightly sweet - and superb! Smooth, fizzy texture is extremely pleasing. If you visit the Pacific Northwest, look for this one!","1707: Aroma is absolutely heavenly - smoky with firm tones of quality coffee, molasses and sweet chocolate and a hint of licorice. It pours a deep, rich, warm opaque sable with a thick dark tan head that leaves some good lacing. Mouth filling flavor has a decided mocha core, quality coffee and chocolate plus licorice, molasses and even a bit of hoppy bitterness. Smooth flavor has a firm and biting fizz, and it leaves a smoky, slightly bitter, tingly finish. If ever you are in Oregon, grab a bottle - or better yet, grab two or three so you have something to trade.","1127: Let me start by sharing what's on the side of the bottle: \"For all you people who are afraid of beer you can't see through, this one is for you. This beer is yellow, fizzy, and clearly meant for washing dirt out of your mouth after mowing the lawn.\" I'm not even sure it's good for that. It's definitely yellow and fizzy, with no head to speak of, and zero lacing. It almost smells like a loaf of bread, and nearly tastes the same. It's very earthy and grainy with nary a hop to be found. Man, I love me some Caldera, but I would rather drink a Bud Light than this on a hot summer day. Sorry guys, but this beer gets an F.","1939: Hazy yellow...taste is not bad, but I wouldnt say its great either. Definitely better than mass-marketed yellow brews that come in a can. And its in a can....so pool and beach safe. Light flavor, light hops, easy to drink. Can Bonus....I'll have to try this one again in the summer.","1376: A- Nice golden color. Looks what a pale ale should. There is very little head, which resembles that of something that is going to have a lot of hops. We will see... S- Why yes I can smell those wonderful whole flower cascade hops. T- There is a nice maltyness with this beer. Not so much of a hop taste, but it is there. M- Feels a bit slimy, or at least makes my mouth become slimy. D- I can drink it with the greatest of ease.","158: Pours a nice clear golden pale with foamy white head. Smells nice with very apparent herbal hop aroma. Taste is smooth with a nice crackery malt flavor and a big bitter hop finish. A tad overly bitter for your typical pale ale, maybe needs a bit more malt but I still like it. Plus it comes in a can which is a GREAT thing. Go cans.","210: Thanks to Flexabull to sending me this one out in the vet BIF. I like canned brews that are good and this one fit the bill. Can poured into a strain pint glass produced a nice amount of white head that settled to a lace. The body was clear golden amber in color This brew had plenty of floral hops aromas coming from the glass I could tell this was a west coat brew. The flavor was very hop forward too. I think it was extremely close to an IPA in my book, but I have noticed more and more of the APA's heading in that direction. It was crisp and light in the mouth. The brew was quite enjoyable to drink and I easily could have drank a six pack at a BBQ","282: Served from a can into a pint glass. Appears orange with a touch of gold. Foamy head present. Smell is underwhelming. Don't puck up too much on the hops front. Taste is good. There's sone hops with a tasty malt balance. Mouthfeel is creamy and full. Nice! Overall a pretty hoof experience. I'd have this again.","552: A: Very pale golden color with pretty much no head whatsoever. S: Kind of weird but a little intriguing as well. Lots of rose petals and rose water here. Some faint hints of yeast and bread as well. T: Yeah, this isn't good. Lots of floral notes but there's no hint of the base beer here at all. A bit of a buttery note with some yeast, but that's about it. Mouthfeel is waaay thin and watery.","673: The beer looks ok in the glass. A bit hazy with a nice thick head. It smells like butterscotch with a hint of citrus. It tastes like butterscotch with a bit of hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is ok but I can't get past the butterscotch. Am I tasting diacetyl?","765: I didn't know what to expect from this brew when I ordered it up. I think the thing to keep in mind is this: if you are not a hop-head but love the flavor of the hop smell, this is the one for you! When I took the first sip, I realized that what this should have been called is \"hopjuice\". The taste is the supreme incarnation of Cascade hop aroma stripped off of the bitterness. I thought it was wonderful, although I knocked it down because the underlying beer characteristic did not push through as much as I would have liked. Being a NW interpretation of Red, however, the balance stood on its own very well. Terrific and recommended if you can get it.","780: Copper and light red pour, standard head to it. Dry hopping nose was there, but not huge, not super awesome or anything, just a bit of subtle vegetal hop quality to it with the peat malt thing. Citrus quality comes out on the tongue. Bitterness sustains itself throughout the entire beer. Pretty much an ordinary red spruced up with some green hops, and yes, it works. Makes the ordinary a little less ordinary. Doesn't skimp on the maltiness either. Dry finish for a red. Solid stuff, would drink again, and definitely recommend to someone who likes red ales. I am not fond of them, but enjoyed this.","783: Poured from the can into a glass tumbler. Nice aroma and pale yellow appearance. Nice fluffy head and fair amount of lacing. Taste was a big surprise, I thought any beer from a can would be a let-down. The initial malt sweetness was nicely balanced by the hop bitterness. Not like an IPA for sure but impressive anyway. Mouthfeel was O.K. and drinkability was good. Made with whole flower Cascade hops.","839: My first beer from this brew...and what a goodie! Over a finger of off-white head lingers over a translucent amber. The head lives a good amount of sticky lacing all over the glass. Aromas of floral and herbal hops with a sweet but bready maltiness as a distance backbone. Earthy notes in both the aroma and taste. Tons of bitter residuals linger on the palate, thanks in part to a medium mouthfeel. This is a delicious IPA, and I look forward to grabbing more cans from this brewery!","883: Snagged a can of this after seeing that it's got such a positive amount of reviews. The beer poured out as a clear yellowish gold color, it has a pretty good looking soapy head on it. The lacing is a little sticky but not too much. The smell of the beer has a really nice malty and hoppy aroma. The hops smell bright and fruity. The taste of the beer was pretty good. The hops were definitely in there ready to hit ya in the mouth. The malt cleaned up the mess in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was light and refreshing. Overall it was a pretty good IPA.","1009: Pours a clear gold color, with a big impressive white head. Nice hoppy cascade nose. Floral, and pine like. Beer has a pretty light quality. But is still tasty. Light crisp hop flavor, a bit of malty sweetness and creaminess, and a slightly piney and resiny hop finish. Nice simple APA. Mouthfeel is pretty good. As mentioned, it's a bit light, but still feels nice in the mouth. Drinkability is very good. Light and easy drinking, yet still a tasty APA. Session worthy. I love canned craft beer!","1031: Tapped this open and a fruity piney smell, Cloudy golden orange color when poured in a pint glass. Nice foaming thick head. Big and hoppy, yet smooth as butter. Minimal hop after taste (I like this, so was a liittle disappointed with the lack there of there) However, a delicious beer. Would drink it anytime!! I bet on draft it is a delight!","1126: Poured from a can into a pint glass A - Amber in color with a thick, off-white head. S - Not as much hop aroma as I had hoped. There is some citrusy hop aroma and a bit of stickiness to it. T - better hop character in the taste. Good malt backbone to balance the hops. The finish is a bit chalky and biscuity. M - The biscuitiness interferes with the mouthfeel to me. A bit too thick on the tongue for an IPA. D - Nothing unpleasant about the way this one goes down. Alcohol is well masked and the carbonation level is right where it needs to be.","1152: A= basic blonde, mild white head, decent lacing. S= honey and floral hops notes. More evident as the beer warmed for a few minutes. T= immediately astringent and dry, somewhat watery, some florals, pine, bitters. M= astringent, some bitterness, florals. D= fine if you like it, depends on the price versus better APA offerings.","1265: A: Yellow and clear. Nice 1 finger white head. S: Not much here. Slight Cascade hops and malt. I was a bit disappointed at first because the smell was unimpressive. T: A nice mix of the C hops. This gives a mouth full of bitter grapefruit and citrus. M: Very bitter, just like it should be. It is also quite crisp, which makes for a refreshing IPA. No alcohol burn at all. D: This is an excellent easy drinking IPA. I wish the aroma was a little more hoppy, but overall I enjoyed the brew. I am happy to find this on the shelves at my local craft beer store.","1490: Drank 11\u002f5\u002f11 A: A slightly reddish amber hue, with a head that dissipates quickly and completely. Intriguing simply because it's a different color. S: It smells like an orange chocolate bar. Not what I was expecting at all, but I like it. Not the most exceptional or complex beer I've had, but it's good. T: Again, orange chocolate. Mmm mmm good. Very well balanced, and not a hint of booze. M: Good intermediate body, but nothing special. O: I enjoyed this beer, but I much prefer Caldera's other offerings.","1627: HOPS! If you like a hoppy beer, this is for you. Pours a golden brown with a nice foamy head. Complex flavors keep you interested with citrus and fruity notes. Just enough maltiness to keep the hops from being completely overwhelming. Aroma is strong with fruity citrus notes as well.","1759: Standard lighter yellow pale ale here, good foamy head. Nice soft floral hop arrangement, if you like caldera, you'll be all good here. Plenty of taste in a pale, relative hefty amount of hops for style, light, ever so light toasting of the malt allows the hops to shine without making them exist in a ridiculous amount. Bitterness is sturdy, minty and metallic, but not a distraction or covering up the more delicate aspect of the beer, would say it leans to the grapefruit side of hop taste, cascade, chinook seem to be all over this one.","1811: A: pours clear, pale orange maybe some yellow. The head is about a finger and a half of off white head. The head did settle down to a thin layer and did leave a good amount of lacing. S: malt is sweet, slightly grainy. Hops are a little piny, and a little bit grassy. T: again with the sweet lightly grainy malt. Hops bring about, mostly pine, a little citrus, and even some grass to the palate. M: carbonation is tingly and nice. Otherwise it smooth on the palate. O: yet another impressive brew from a can, good balanced flavor.","1905: Clear dark amber with a good three finger white head. Plentiful lacings. Aroma is fruity citrus hops with a bit of leather. Taste is full deep leathery bitter hops with the correct amount of malts. The label describes \"centennial hops\" as the mainstay of all that bitterness. Mouthfeel is just right, and drinkability is very good for this style. Kudos to Caldera for daring to bottle a limited production beer. Their normal regimen is cans. Cool label. Give the fellows from the \"State of Jefferson\" a big thumbs up! Keep it coming Caldera!","1907: Poured into an imperial nonic a clear copper with a great one finger sticky white head that nver really leaves,a frothy mass is there during the whole duration of the glass.Big caramel malt in the nose with subdued citric hops,a little hop oomph and it would be great.Citric and herbal hops play against a big caramel\u002fbiscuit malt base with neither getting the upper heand really.There is a little lightly roasted nuttiness in the malt profile as well.A beer thats oh so close to being stellar,just bump up the hop profile and there you go,as is its pretty good.","1400: Review from BeerAdvocate Magazine Issue #42 (Jul 2010): YES! More craft brewers need to adjunct their beer. The lacing has staying power, though the haze on the yellow is distracting. This lager packs a yeasty, grassy aroma. Crisp and a bit slick, obvious light body. Fresh- cut grass and nutty yeast coat the palate; hops are fresh with ample bitterness and a good amount of flavor, which brings this beer up a few notches. The maltiness is a bit light, but right where it's supposed to be. Flavor overrides cleanliness. Very drinkable as well.","695: Wow added as a extra from SwillinBrew (Gil) Thank you so nice and from a Can !!! no less. A nice brew seek it out it. S - Nice blown away really nice perhaps because it was from a can. T - has a nice smell that I think most idpas reach for. M - chewy nice a sweet canned brew. D - would have again and again so nice I love canned microbrew.","839: My first beer from this brew...and what a goodie! Over a finger of off-white head lingers over a translucent amber. The head lives a good amount of sticky lacing all over the glass. Aromas of floral and herbal hops with a sweet but bready maltiness as a distance backbone. Earthy notes in both the aroma and taste. Tons of bitter residuals linger on the palate, thanks in part to a medium mouthfeel. This is a delicious IPA, and I look forward to grabbing more cans from this brewery!","1414: I had this one on tap at the Horse Brass in Portland, Oregon. It came in dark orange\u002fgolden color with a good sized frothy white head that left lacing on the glass all the way down. It smelled very hoppy and sweet\u002fsour in a citrus way as well. The taste was great. Very hoppy and bitter with a kind of sweet citrus tone to it as well. Mouthfeel was good, this one has some bite and it left a dry\u002fbitter aftertaste that made my mouth water for more. Overall this is a good beer, tastes great, goes down smooth, doesn't disappoint.","1320: I had this on tap last in August of 2009 at Bailey's Taproom in Portland, Oregon. The colour was a very dark brown with a garnet base and a thin tan head. The aroma was full of coffee, roasted malt and chocolate. On the palate, there was light CO2, day old coffee, some dark chocolate and more roasted malt.","1668: On tap tonight at the Horse Brass. Nice looking orangy amber ale with a tiny white head that lasts no time, some lace left. Aroma is pleasant but nothing special ..of hops and malts with a touch or orange peel zest. The taste was exhilarating to start with the hops blending well with the orange peel falavours but after a while it bacame dullish,but themalts held throughout. Mouthfeel was rather on the thin side and average for style This is a nice beer but for once I think this would be better served quite chilled.","1450: Picked up a six pack of this one in a recent trade. Pours out a nice orange color with a smallish head. Aromas of oranges, pine and hops. On the palate, this one is very hoppy and enjoyable to drink. Another nice canned beer, enjoyable in the summer sun.","39: A can picked up in Baltimore. Pours a clear amber color with lots of foamy off-white head. Good retention leaves some spotty lacing. Smells of grassy hops, bread, caramel, and earth. Tastes of bread, toasted grains, caramel, lite citrus, and an earthy and grassy finish. Medium in body with good carbonation. Clean and smooth, malty and grainy with a nice bitter finish. Refreshing and easy to drink, a nice canned amber ale that I would definitely enjoy while out and about in the Summer time.","281: Received this can through Beer Powerball. I am really sorry that I don't know who sent it, my brother is keeping those records, but THANK YOU!! Pours with a nice half centimeter white fluffy head on a glass of dark straw-colored beer. Smells of citrusy hoppy goodness and oddly, a little like soap. Mouthfeel is very pleasant as is taste. This is a nice drinking beer. It's not blow you away with over-the-top flavor. It's a well-balanced, highly drinkable and enjoyable brew. I'm glad to have gotten the chance to try it.","312: This bottle was hand delivered from my brother who lives in Portland, OR. The beers pours a deep burnt orange color with a small white head. Very nice lacing on the glass. The dominant smell is of sweet caramel. Taste is also sweet caramel with a strong earthly, almost dirty, hop finish that hangs! A decent beer, but much more malty than I would expect from a beer called Hopportunity Knocks.","690: Can recieved in a recent trade as en extra. A: Decent head, takes a minute or so to settle down. Very clear light orange colored beer. Some lacing. S: Fruity scents with not too much hops present in the nose. T: This beer just is not a solid example of the style. Really not much of a hop presence at all. With what I have heard about Caldera 'Old Growth' I was hoping this would be a pleasant surprise. I'd skip this one if I was looking for a solid IPA M: Low to medium carbonation. Slightly oily mouthfeel. O: Move along, nothing to see here.","855: picked up a six-pack because I have been hearing good things about this beer. A- dont know much since I drank it out of the can. T- Wow this stuff is great! the pine taste and citrus just explode in your mouth at the first drink. Unfortunately only one store carries this in my area and it is a bit of a trip but well worth it for one of the best beers out of a can you ever had.","876: Thanks to rayjay for the extra in a trade. Pours a slightly hazy orange with a nice, tight white head that laces like glue. Smells of massive amounts of hops, damn near all of them. Lots of citrus and pine, with some caramel malt as well. Tastes wonderfully hoppy, tons of pine and citrus yet an almost grainy note, also slightly vegetal. There is a lot of malt here to back things up, there's a nice tight carbonation and it feels dense. Very easy to drink on after an evening of flying frizbee.","911: My main man woodychandler comes through with yet another canned beer for me to try. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a orange\u002fbrownish color with a 1\u002f2 inch head. Smell is very hoppy, not much else. Taste is also all hops, dry and bitter, not much else coming through. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer.","1031: Tapped this open and a fruity piney smell, Cloudy golden orange color when poured in a pint glass. Nice foaming thick head. Big and hoppy, yet smooth as butter. Minimal hop after taste (I like this, so was a liittle disappointed with the lack there of there) However, a delicious beer. Would drink it anytime!! I bet on draft it is a delight!","1082: Found this on vacation at the piggly wiggly in Myrtle Beach, SC. What a pleasnt treat \u002fsuprise!Tasted great even right out of the can.Appeared to have a deep golden color kind of darkish. Smelled nice and hoppy and fruity small bit of floral.Taste was straight up IPA wich is a great thing in my book.Mouth was smooth and pleasant with a nice amount of hops bitterness.These babies have a drinkability that is very nice,went down real nice in the heat and the cans were a big plus for transportation.Wish this brew was around my area!!!!","1145: Was pretty excited to see some limited 22's from Caldera down this way. Interesting art work on the bottle. A-ruby, brown almost a dark mahogany, small half finger head and translucent S-Orange, cherry and chocolate-Terry Chocolate Orange upfront, a faint grassy smell in the end T- light malts and belgian yeast. light orange and cherries with a slight bitterness on the end M-watery, light carbonation, not much body to it D-Overall, the taste was interesting but light, I wish it tasted as good as the smell was. There was not much body to this one for being a strong dark Belgian.","1155: A: In a pint glass. Clear amber, nice yellowish head. S: Piney, citrusy hops. Malty, bready, herbal. T: Like smell. Bitter. I like this. MF: Like most beers for me, not remarkable; standard for the style. D: Very drinkable. It's a little pricey and only sold by the can. But if it were cheaper\u002fsold in 6 packs here I'd definitely pick up a sixer.","1299: Amber with hints of orange with big tan foamy head with good retention and uneven lacing. Big citrus hop aroma. Big bitter grapefruit up frony with good caramel mellowing backbone. Smooth, silky feel with a low carb feel despite the big foamy head. A good overhopped IPA that's pleasant yet slightly one dimensional. Not worth $13.50\u002f6 pack unless you really need a good IPA in a can.","1433: Picked up a 6-pack at State Line in Maryland. Poured a golden amber with a good white head. This beer reminds me of Dale's Pale Ale, and not because of the can. There's a big punch of citrus and pine hops that's met (more so here than with Dale's) by a hit of caramel malt. Very drinkable and a tasty, more balanced IPA.","1490: Drank 11\u002f5\u002f11 A: A slightly reddish amber hue, with a head that dissipates quickly and completely. Intriguing simply because it's a different color. S: It smells like an orange chocolate bar. Not what I was expecting at all, but I like it. Not the most exceptional or complex beer I've had, but it's good. T: Again, orange chocolate. Mmm mmm good. Very well balanced, and not a hint of booze. M: Good intermediate body, but nothing special. O: I enjoyed this beer, but I much prefer Caldera's other offerings.","1690: Consumed 11\u002f4\u002f10 Got in a trade from ILikeBrew, thanks Micah for some Pacific Northwest Beer! Poured into Alchemist Brewery pint glass A: Pours clear dark orange with an inch of soapy head. Hangs to the glass pretty well to the bottom. S: Caramel malts, grapefruit, some pine resin T: Mild fruit up front, then the caramel\u002ftoasted malts in the middle. Finishes dry and bitter, nice punch. F: Slightly less than medium, with lower carbonation than I'd prefer. D: Pretty low carbonation for the big IPAs I'm used to drinking, so I could definitely do a few of these in a night.","1801: Purchased in Portland during my spring break Pacific Northwest trip, the only bottle offering I've had from Caldera. Poured is a orange hued color. This IPA tastes maltier than the ones I used to have. Drinking at near room temperature made this even maltier-tasting, which isn't necessarily bad, but to me it tastes more like an amber than an IPA. It's a good beer but not outstanding.","1816: This has recently hit the NC market...in reading reviews I' puzzled at the reviews. This is an AWESOME IPA...simply awesome. Appearance is great, cloudy with a very decent 2\" head. Smell is fresh hops and malt...more hops than malt. Taste is mostly all grapefruit hops...I love it. Right next to G'Night (Gordon) as the best beer from a can...I gave my son a can and even his collage buddies who don't like IPA's said it was amazing. The price point is a little high ($13 for a sixer) in NC but I love this brew.","1885: This is a great beer in the canned beer arena. Had no option but to drink this straight from the can so I can't comment on appearance. Had a nice scent of bitter citrus and pine. Hops contribute a moderate bitterness consisting of both grapefruit and pine flavors, on top of a lightly sweet pale malt backbone.. Mouthfeel was crisp and pleasing with generous carbonation. Had a couple of these on a hike and found them to be great for the occasion.","1893: Smell is light, almost non-existent, must be trapped in the dark amber. Very light head tops a thin effervescent surface. Taste is belgian yet bitter, with very little of the promised oranges. I'm getting a lot of roast out of this, which normally would be a compliment but it just doesn't fit what I was expecting. Aside from the bitter notes the beer is pretty good, it's almost like a belgian strong dark coffee stout ale.","1848: A: Dark amber with a slight hint of red. S: Lots of citrus, but it's kind of weak. T: Good hop flavor, pretty bitter. You get an immediate citrus flavor followed quickly by the bitterness. M: Medium body, a little too bitter and malty on the aftertaste for me. Much prefer their IPA in a can. D: Moderate drinkability, I had the bomber myself, and didn't want another one. I too was excited to see a Caldera in a bottle, but after tasting it I much prefer their IPA or Pale Ale in a can.","10: A: poured a caramel brown with a thin head that left a little bit of sticky lacing on the glass. S: at first I get caramel aromas with a underlying floral hop notes which had a good malt presence. There was also some citrus and bready notes as well. T: some nice piney hops pop out on the taste with caramel and citrus grapefruit accents that help out on the bitterness. It seems to have a decent malt backbone that helps out the balance. M: medium body with a low amount of carbonation that still works out but had a slight sweet and bitter hop finish. D: pretty good IPA that drank well and had a good amount of sweetness but lacked on the hop punch. It was still a tasty brew.","39: A can picked up in Baltimore. Pours a clear amber color with lots of foamy off-white head. Good retention leaves some spotty lacing. Smells of grassy hops, bread, caramel, and earth. Tastes of bread, toasted grains, caramel, lite citrus, and an earthy and grassy finish. Medium in body with good carbonation. Clean and smooth, malty and grainy with a nice bitter finish. Refreshing and easy to drink, a nice canned amber ale that I would definitely enjoy while out and about in the Summer time.","103: Pours a dark amber with a moderate head. Smell is pretty nice! Pine and tropical fruits. Taste starts with a nice blend of bitter pine and fruit punch, without being overly sweet. Pretty dry finish, medium-light mouth. This is a nice little surprise and drinkable but not complex enough to be interesting beyond one. But overall for what it is, Caldera has a winner.","120: 12 oz. can into duvel tulip glass appearance: looks good ruby\u002forange\u002fstrawlike color with some heavy headiness, definitely dissipating though, doesnt look too carbonated smell\u002ftaste: smelling some fruitiness and some hops also and some malty balanced undertones. the taste is hoppy and not overbearing, kind of not full bodied enough. a different one this is mf: not really slick or thick just a runny ipa drink: could drink a few my first offering from caldera, ill have to try some more flavors","242: Big thanks to G311 for this one. A - Nice big IPA appearance: deep amber with a rich head, though lesser retention and lace. S - Really a very muted nose. It is nearly astoundingly so. T - The taste is quite a bit more, well, existent... because there is really nothing but a ghost of and IPA there in the aroma dept. A bit floral and grassy, and some caramel; tastes good, just not exceptional. M - IPA. A little flaccid. D - Doesn't measure up to the Red Racer IPA that preceded it (not that it was world-class, either). Probably not even as good as the regular Caldera IPA.","248: a: dark brown with amber highlights, no head or lacing. s: dark malts, medicine, little orange and rubbing alochol. t: malts, caramel, no medicine but dark fruits, other than bitters no other orange taste detected. m: full body with some bitterness. o: worth trying once, dont think i'll seek this one out again.","323: Cloudy, brownish amber. Medium, foamy, off-white head. Some carbonation and a touch of lacing. Earthy, floral hop aroma, some bready malts. Flavor has more earthy hops, lots of bready, grainy malt. Heavy-ish body but not sweet. A nutty aftertaste. Odd for a west coast IPA; not hoppy at all but not much malt flavor or complexity going on either.","327: Served from can into a Delerium Tremens tulip. Pours a hazy red-orange with a one finger off-white head that slowly subsides to minimal. Maintains decent lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt, hops, and pine. The flavor was of malt and a load of hops. It was medium on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a very nice IPA from a can no-less. Definitely worth seeking out if you are an IPA fan as it is quite drinkable and enjoyable. I will be having another in the near future.","388: Poured from a can into my snifter. A - A clear golden orange, slightly burnt red color body with a medium frothy light white head. S - Very nice and big citrus hop smell that is smooth and sweet. Very pleasant. T & M & D - Great fruit sweetness up front that is refreshing and almost minty cool. Then some bigger malty sweetness on mid palate and the slight fruit acidity cleans the end and brings in some slight airy floral notes. The mouth is light and very drinkable, I go back to refreshing. O - Awesome IPA and I love the can. They really pull of the style well. One of my favorites that I come back to often. -Cheers","486: Apperance: Orange-y, light amber. Lacing left on the glass. Smell: Nice citrus hop aroma thats pretty minimal of a NW IPA, a nice chance. Taste: Malt flavor is rapidly replaced with a pretty bitter lasting hop finish. T Mouthfeel: darn easy drink.... Drinkability: Tasty beer, Id drink this again.","553: Thanks to ibrew2or3 AKA McLargeHuge A: Pours a nice light bright golden yellow\u002forange hue with a small fizzy head. There is little retenion and spotty lace. S: Nice big hop aroma. There is a huge blast of grapefruit and a bit of grass. A touch of sweet malt lurks beneath. T: This one starts nice and bold. A big blast of grapefruit right from the start. Some malt cuts thru do tone things down in the middle, but the finish is nice and bitter. M: Medium body with great carbonation. D: Perfect summer brew for Florida as it comes in a can. One of the best canned IPA's out there.","608: Poured into pint glass. A - reminiscent of a pilsner more than an APA, 2 fingers of white head, head lasted a while, just kinda floated there S - light hints of citrus, mostly grapefruit and lemon, maybe a little bready T - hop blast, pretty bitter and dry, follows the smell closely M - good carbonation, good body for the style, not too light and certainly not heavy D - great for a canned beer, cant beat the portability and taste, just started to get the caldera brews in my local beer store, will continue to try new ones","633: A: Pours a clear golden color, not too much head or lacing down the glass S: Grassy\u002fpiney type hop scent, nothing too fragrant though T: Mild sweetness followed by a nice crisp grassy\u002fherbal hop flavor M: Light to medium bodied, carbonation is pretty good O: This is a nice summer BBQ beer, I think i may like their amber better but this one is a decent pale.","649: A-Full bronze. big light tan head. brilliantly clear. S-Some toasty malt. Light citrus hop aroma. Not a lot going on. T-Carmelly malty. Firm bitterness but more balanced to the malt than their Pale ale. Not much in the way of hop flavor. Lots of bitterness but not much flavor. M-medium bodied. medium carbonation. No alcohol burn. D-An average tasting IPA. Needs more hop flavor and aroma. Bitterness and malt are spot on. Still not a bad beer.","660: Can from Beerzack. Thanks! Pours Semi-clear reddish amber witha big lasting chunky whitish head that leaves lots of lacing. Smell is sweet fruity, fresh and hoppy. Very nice. Taste is smooth with fruity caramel and fresh citrusy, and sweet orange flavored hops and bitter citrus rind. Nice and strongly bittered which lasts in the finish but with a light lingering sweetness too. Very good IPA.","661: Nice amber color with a great head and lacing, plus it's in a can! Love it when beers are in cans. It smells piney and earthy and gains in the taste. Earthy Munich malts balance with a lot of citrusy and herbal northwestern hops, with some metallic and peppery notes sneaking in to make a solid but not outstanding IPA. Slight stickiness to the mouthfeel, but very drinkable overall.","683: No Canned on Date A - Pours a rich amber color. Completely clear, with minimal head. S - Sweet hoppy syrupy smells. Hints of piney resin. T - Piney, resin, floral hops. No noticeable citrus qualities. Finishes very dry and bitter. M - Medium body with moderate to high carbonation. Just right for an IPA. D - Nothing I would go out of my to get again, but nothing I'd turn down either. This is a solid IPA. Not a lot to rant about, both positive and negative. The flavors are pretty one dimensional, bitter piney hops, no citrus undertones that I enjoy so much.","722: Nice dark orange colured ale, small lightv tan head. I dont like the aroma, it certainlly has hops aplenty, but has a sour ,sweaty work sock aroma that puts me off in the background. The flavor is better, very strong oniony hopping, pink grapefruit and spruce tips. Thin and maybe even a tad under carbonated. I dint really dig this one. I liked their Pale Ale way better.","769: Pours out a clear, amber\u002forange with a 2-finger, thick, white head that leaves moderate, splotchy lacing. The smell is both fruity and malty, malt dominates. Taste is fruity, citrus hops up front then overtaken by a strong malt flavor and finishes with bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium, well-carbonated at first but low later. Drinkability is fine. I like it and many of those who like IPAs will also.","891: A - pours an amber color with a two finder head that is retained for a good 5-10 minutes. The beer is almost as clear as a lager...not cloudy at all. S - very strong citrus smells. T - similar to the smells, the first predominant taste is citrusy. After that, you get a hint of caramel. Then the hops come through and leave a nice bitterness finish. D - I love this IPA. It's one of my favorites! It's exactly how a west coast IPA should taste. The only issue could be a slight lack in carbonation.... But I find that true of most craft can beer I try.","907: I assume this is fairly fresh as it is the first time I have seen it at my favorite beer store. Pours clear amber with a one finger white head. Fair lacings. Aroma is very hoppy for the style. Taste is quite hoppy earthy slight citrus and a firm but not overly sweet backbone. Medium dry mildly bitter finish. A bit astringent on the palate. Not sweet and cloying like most American Ambers. I think this is a bit on the bitter side for the style. Which would make it closer to a PA which I like very much. So for my tastes this is fine. If you enjoy your ambers on the sweeter side you better pass on this beer.","924: A: Dark amber in color, the head was amazing. Slighly off white head, with enough retention to balance the can on it if I wanted to. S: Lots of citrus and piney hops. T: Wasn't sure what to expect from my first \"real\" can of beer. It was very well balanced. You had a good citrus and piney resin working together on this one. M\u002fD: It had good carbonation, the end was mildly bitter and oily. I thought this was a great first for me.","932: A - hazey orange in color with a rocky white head which quickly dissipates to a thin film. S - the nose is rich with hops. piney and fruity. sweet caramel malt notes and some cherry esters. T - clean, lightly sweet malt upfront followed by some piney bitterness and a long cherry\u002fsweetish finish. M - smooth, creamy, a touch watery and a full zippy carbonation. O - nice IPA with lots of piney notes but could've had a bit more bitterness on the tongue.","1072: Can from K&L Redwood City. A - Pours a bright medium amber color with a two-finger, lasting off-white head and good lacing. S - Aroma is piney and citrusy hops, a touch of sweet malt, and tropical fruits. T - Flavor is a little pale and caramel malt, but mostly showcases a complex hop profile, with pine, pineapple, orange, and grapefruit. Pretty harshly bitter, although I like that of course. M - Crisp palate with medium body and carbonation. D - Solid. Overall this is the best canned IPA I've had after Surly Furious.","1073: Thanks to 5000 for sending this can my way. The beer pours a dark amber color with a white head. Darker than expected. The aroma is very nice. I get a lot of grapefruit and pine notes. The flavor is similar. The predominant flavor is some resiny pine from the hops but I also get some grapefruit. The toffee and caramel malt backbone balance out the beer nicely and keep the bitterness level fairly low for a west coast IPA. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very nice.","1136: A- Pours a nice amber color with a whit head. S- Hops with a citrus tone hint of malt. T- Hops and citrus tones with a hint of a malt finish. M- Semi dry with hop flavors through out sip and a malt finish. D- Pretty good beer from Oregon. I can drink this again with no worries. Cheers...","1145: Was pretty excited to see some limited 22's from Caldera down this way. Interesting art work on the bottle. A-ruby, brown almost a dark mahogany, small half finger head and translucent S-Orange, cherry and chocolate-Terry Chocolate Orange upfront, a faint grassy smell in the end T- light malts and belgian yeast. light orange and cherries with a slight bitterness on the end M-watery, light carbonation, not much body to it D-Overall, the taste was interesting but light, I wish it tasted as good as the smell was. There was not much body to this one for being a strong dark Belgian.","1155: A: In a pint glass. Clear amber, nice yellowish head. S: Piney, citrusy hops. Malty, bready, herbal. T: Like smell. Bitter. I like this. MF: Like most beers for me, not remarkable; standard for the style. D: Very drinkable. It's a little pricey and only sold by the can. But if it were cheaper\u002fsold in 6 packs here I'd definitely pick up a sixer.","1162: Poured into a tulip glass. A light golden orange color. Very clear with almost 2 fingers of creamy rich pillowy head. This thing smells like candied hops. Lots of orange citrus covered in caramel. Tastes alot like the aroma only a bit on the lighter side. The citrus is there, the caramel is there and there is also a small amount of floral notes as well. Light to medium bodied with a crisp bitter finish. Overall this is an excellent canned IPA that i could drink all day long. Notes: Review taken from notes written on 5-25-10","1168: A: Poured a pale amber color, clear with good carbonation leaving a nice white head S: Light caramel, hops, bitterness, some citrus and floral notes T: Floral and citrus with impressive hops, def a American West Coast IPA here. M: Lighter bodied with hop bitterness leaving a crisp, bitterness D: Good. I actually thought this could have been a modest single IPA as well","1299: Amber with hints of orange with big tan foamy head with good retention and uneven lacing. Big citrus hop aroma. Big bitter grapefruit up frony with good caramel mellowing backbone. Smooth, silky feel with a low carb feel despite the big foamy head. A good overhopped IPA that's pleasant yet slightly one dimensional. Not worth $13.50\u002f6 pack unless you really need a good IPA in a can.","1303: Appearance: Pours a hazy, yellow-orange body with a thin, wispy white head. Smell: Aroma of herbal, citrus hops accompanied by a honey-laden maltiness. Taste: Mild pale malts with a bit of toastiness and a soft honey-like sweetness. Citrus and bitter herbs. Medium bitterness. Finishes dry. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Drinkability: A fair pale ale, but I gotta say I enjoyed the Caldera IPA far, far more.","1304: Poured amber from the can. Nice one inch head with plenty of lacing. Aroma is earthy citrus hops and a bit of sweet malt. Flavor is usual hops citrus and pine in this case. Nice balance of hops and malts with hops dominating. Good mouthfeel not too watery. Amazingly good canned beer! Highly recommended if you enjoy IPA's. Try the APA also.","1327: Pours a clean orange-ish to copper color with a light tan head. In the aroma, faint pine like hops. In the taste, mellow pine hops and a nice malt balance. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry to clean hop aftertaste. More a pale than IPA, but decent nonetheless.","1352: This one is eclipsed by the regular Caldera IPA that comes in a can unfortunately... I was looking for a more pronounced citrus bitterness and this was more floral and fragrant in nature... A different animal altogether and this somehow missed the mark for me... A fairly average brew with just a nint of hops to it and this bottle should be pretty fresh... This wasn't bad, mind you, but it just tasted and felt rather run of the mill to me...","1411: A- Nice bright red color with a pretty foamy head. Lace is allready showing off and trying to get me to take a sip before finishing the sentance. S- Heavy citrus blend with a sweet finish. Smells like a much hoppier beer than an IPA. T- Much maltier than the nose lets on, sweeter too. I taste a lot of grain and oils. Slightly buttery. M- Truely a medium bodied sample. Not watery but definatley not full either. D- Good pick up from the store as something new. Not something I would recommend to a friend as a must try, but a maybe try for those looking to try new IPAs. Thanks Caldera...another decent brew from Oregon.","1479: A - pours a deep rust orange with 1\u002f4 inch of white foam S - citrus and hints of piney hops T - slightly citrus hops with a major piney hop kick at the end, not overpoweringly bitter, just a really tasty treat M\u002fD - medium bodied and decent carbonation, definitely a nice IPA that I could have several of","1490: Drank 11\u002f5\u002f11 A: A slightly reddish amber hue, with a head that dissipates quickly and completely. Intriguing simply because it's a different color. S: It smells like an orange chocolate bar. Not what I was expecting at all, but I like it. Not the most exceptional or complex beer I've had, but it's good. T: Again, orange chocolate. Mmm mmm good. Very well balanced, and not a hint of booze. M: Good intermediate body, but nothing special. O: I enjoyed this beer, but I much prefer Caldera's other offerings.","1502: A: Nice amber color with quite an impressive head. About what you'd expect from a good IPA :) S: Very citrusy, lots of grapefruit, lemons, etc.. T: Surprisingly non-bitter. Tastes closer to an APA than an IPA. Nice clean grapefruit with a bit of bitterness on the back end (but not too much). M: Surprisingly light. Carbonation suits it perfect to keep it crisp. O: Overall pretty impressive for a beer I've never heard of. Not too hoppy, not too malty, not too bitter, just does everything pretty well (but not amazingly, admittedly).","1514: A: Pale amber in color, beutifully clear, with a nice white head. S: Sweet caramel, a slight tropical fruit flavor with a hint of pine wood. T: Sweet fruit flavor at first, followed by a nice tropical hops flavor. A bit of a malt in the back, but the hop flavor dominate. Not too bitter, just pleasantly hoppy. M: Medium bodied, slightly chewy, perhaps a little over carb'd D: Very good overall, but I would like to see a little more balance from the malty side. I think the hop profile is dead on.","1623: A: Beer poured a light amber color with a orange hue and large 1\" off white head that lasted for sometime. Good lacing on the sides of the glass throughout consumption. S: Citrus, orange pith, pine, and some light caramel notes. T: As with the smell I get grapefruit, orange pith, lots of pine and some light caramel malt balance. This one is pretty hop dominate. M: Medium-light bodied, good carbonation with a drying finish. D: This beer is definately six pack worth and will be one of my camping beers from here on out.","1649: A: Poured a hazy amber color with a nice white cap S: Faded piney hops, caramel T: Caramel and faded hops battle for dominance while the metallic and old Earthy notes fight for second place. Bad. M: Medium to full body and not one I would recommend hiolding on your palate O: Poor IPA, drainpoured after two sips","1697: appearance - light amber color, just a little darker than I expected from the nose, big frothy head. Smell - very nice hop, pine, some fruit taste - nice hoppy grapefruite taste, dry finish mouthfeel - very even, not too thin, not too chewy for a single ipa overall - solid, I doubt I will pay $12.99 again for this brew and it probably factored into my rating","1717: 12oz bottle into pint glass. Pours a slightly hazy deep gold color with off-white head. Nose gives off notes of mango and grassiness with honey maltiness. Taste is mellow and spicy with notes of date and dried plums. Grassy and green hop presence with smooth bitterness. Moderate carbonation with a dry finish and lingering bitterness. Overall a nice pale ale that has a well-rounded (albeit bitter) flavor profile. Not as full-bodied as others, but good nonetheless.","1721: a- can poured into a pint, two finger off white head with nice retention, hazy tawny amber coloring. s- earthy hops, some pine, grapefruit pith, bitterness, slight malt. t- earthy, bitter grapefruit rind dominates, some pine, some lemon, tasty lingering bitterness as well. m- medium body, slick. d- good, i'd drink this again, but probably wouldn't seek out and buy. this is a solid canned craft ipa though.","1801: Purchased in Portland during my spring break Pacific Northwest trip, the only bottle offering I've had from Caldera. Poured is a orange hued color. This IPA tastes maltier than the ones I used to have. Drinking at near room temperature made this even maltier-tasting, which isn't necessarily bad, but to me it tastes more like an amber than an IPA. It's a good beer but not outstanding.","1828: Eh. A little surprised at the rating here. Pours a copper, reddish orange. Definitely not the familiar yellowish, golden orange of most IPAs. Large off-white head. Smells faintly of pine, more strongly of ... well, citrus. Not quite grapefruit, just citrus-y. And there's maybe a whiff of malt. Well, maybe not. There's a strange toasted after-taste to the malt, and the hop flavoring is a touch muted. Really more like a pale ale than an ipa to me, though not quite that either. Some grapefruit, some random-y citrus notes, and a touch of sweet malt. Decent, but nothing to write home about.","1850: A: pours amber orange with a decent finger of off white head. S: grapefruit and light pine, and floral hop. There is some malt sweetness in the background. T: a nice tounge coating hop, that is piny, a citrus cross between grapefruit and orange. Malt is light but nicely sweet. M: coating hop, though the malt is light in the mouth, good carbonation. O: canned beer is really starting to grow on me, and leaves me impressed enough to try calderas other offerings","1859: Thanks to bman1113vr for sharing this bottle. The beer pours a clear brown color with a tan head. The aroma is heavy on the toffee and not too much else. The flavor is toffee, leather, tobacco, wood and dark fruit. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A decent beer but nothing too exciting.","1905: Clear dark amber with a good three finger white head. Plentiful lacings. Aroma is fruity citrus hops with a bit of leather. Taste is full deep leathery bitter hops with the correct amount of malts. The label describes \"centennial hops\" as the mainstay of all that bitterness. Mouthfeel is just right, and drinkability is very good for this style. Kudos to Caldera for daring to bottle a limited production beer. Their normal regimen is cans. Cool label. Give the fellows from the \"State of Jefferson\" a big thumbs up! Keep it coming Caldera!","1940: Reddish amber with good clarity. Modest head that leaves light lacing. Pretty color, but fairly unusual for an IPA. Pleasant nose but more malty than hoppy - graham cracker maybe? Herbal hop character with moderate lingering bitterness. A bit metallic. Medium bodied. A bit juicy but metallic bitterness builds to dominate the impression.","1897: I got this one from SuperNova777 in my poker winnings. Thanks a lot bud. Poured a great copper color with quite a bit of big white head on it. Decent lacing as well. Smell is full of citrus and hops. Taste is very good - great hop flavor. Mouthfeel is light-medium. This beer goes down very smooth. Really glad I got a chance to try this beer. I really enjoyed it.","281: Received this can through Beer Powerball. I am really sorry that I don't know who sent it, my brother is keeping those records, but THANK YOU!! Pours with a nice half centimeter white fluffy head on a glass of dark straw-colored beer. Smells of citrusy hoppy goodness and oddly, a little like soap. Mouthfeel is very pleasant as is taste. This is a nice drinking beer. It's not blow you away with over-the-top flavor. It's a well-balanced, highly drinkable and enjoyable brew. I'm glad to have gotten the chance to try it.","883: Snagged a can of this after seeing that it's got such a positive amount of reviews. The beer poured out as a clear yellowish gold color, it has a pretty good looking soapy head on it. The lacing is a little sticky but not too much. The smell of the beer has a really nice malty and hoppy aroma. The hops smell bright and fruity. The taste of the beer was pretty good. The hops were definitely in there ready to hit ya in the mouth. The malt cleaned up the mess in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was light and refreshing. Overall it was a pretty good IPA.","1277: Overall a really nice and interesting beer. I saw this on the shelf and hadn't tried anything yet from this brewery but looked interesting. Figured I would try it. It was really a nice beer. It definitely had a lot of smoky and meaty flavor to it! Very interesting and nice beer overall, I would drink it again.","1585: I got this one as an extra from one of those awesome West Coast BAs! Thanks! This one pours a nice golden color with an off-whie head. Nice lacing that lasts. Upon popping the top I was hit immediately by a cascate of hoppy smells coming from the can. Smells delicious with the malt to balance things nicely. The taste follows the nose with a nice, crisp finish. In the mouth this one is nice and creamy. This is a highly drinkable beer. It has a nice hoppy dry finish that keeps your mouth wanting more.","1690: Consumed 11\u002f4\u002f10 Got in a trade from ILikeBrew, thanks Micah for some Pacific Northwest Beer! Poured into Alchemist Brewery pint glass A: Pours clear dark orange with an inch of soapy head. Hangs to the glass pretty well to the bottom. S: Caramel malts, grapefruit, some pine resin T: Mild fruit up front, then the caramel\u002ftoasted malts in the middle. Finishes dry and bitter, nice punch. F: Slightly less than medium, with lower carbonation than I'd prefer. D: Pretty low carbonation for the big IPAs I'm used to drinking, so I could definitely do a few of these in a night.","1711: 22 picked up at Brewforia on the way home from work. Poured into my big Shorts Imperial Pint (thanks Kevin). Foamy 1\" white head dies back into nice lacing... no real retention though... okay cap... the brew is very pale golden with seemingly a lite haze of some sort. Clean grains... little else.. a bit husky and traces of sulfur if I really concentrate. Again... very clean.... pale malts... a bit doughy. Slightly better than expected body and carbonation. Meh... okay I guess... good for what it is... tastes pretty fresh and crisp. 3.5\u002f3\u002f3.5\u002f3.5\u002f4.5","1958: Shared with some friends at a homebrew meeting. A - Pours light golden, 2 fingered head, and dissipates fast. S - Grass, pine, and honey. T - Grass, pine and honey again. M - Bitter, lets you know it's an IPA and it ain't messing around. D - Good, but average Joe would need to appreciate and expect a bitter beer.","505: I had this very nice IPA on-tap at Brewer's Haven in Boise, Idaho after I had completed a little beer shopping. Poured amber with a nice head and great lacing. Smells very fruity with candied orange peel and grapefruit pith. The taste is very full, with bitter hops, breadiness. Sharp pine and earth in the hop profile. A little chewy in the mouth, but ovarall this is dry, bitter, and delicious.","517: Finally starting to see this much hyped brewery show up here in the Fourth Corner. The Amber and Pale I tried weren't all that thrilling so I didn't have much in the way of expectations for the IPA. Well it turned out to be just an average example of the style. It's worth a shot if you see it, but it's not great.","695: Wow added as a extra from SwillinBrew (Gil) Thank you so nice and from a Can !!! no less. A nice brew seek it out it. S - Nice blown away really nice perhaps because it was from a can. T - has a nice smell that I think most idpas reach for. M - chewy nice a sweet canned brew. D - would have again and again so nice I love canned microbrew.","839: My first beer from this brew...and what a goodie! Over a finger of off-white head lingers over a translucent amber. The head lives a good amount of sticky lacing all over the glass. Aromas of floral and herbal hops with a sweet but bready maltiness as a distance backbone. Earthy notes in both the aroma and taste. Tons of bitter residuals linger on the palate, thanks in part to a medium mouthfeel. This is a delicious IPA, and I look forward to grabbing more cans from this brewery!","1433: Picked up a 6-pack at State Line in Maryland. Poured a golden amber with a good white head. This beer reminds me of Dale's Pale Ale, and not because of the can. There's a big punch of citrus and pine hops that's met (more so here than with Dale's) by a hit of caramel malt. Very drinkable and a tasty, more balanced IPA.","1278: Slightly hazed orange-amber with a towering head of persistent, lumpy foam. Sugary citrus zestiness, green pine, and a crackery\u002fdoughy note in the nose. Very smooth hoppy flavor. It doesn't smack you in the face with any sort of brashness, just lovely fresh hops...orange and pine (definitely some Simcoe in there) with a gradualy increasing bitterness that tends to stick to the inside of the mouth. Not particularly \"bright\", it leans more towards the dark and dank side with just the right amount of malty sweetness and a touch of honey. Medium bodied, oily, and bitter. Very nice!","6: Service Temperature, 40 degrees. Service Glassware, 8 ounce ikea globe. Appearance, is copper orange & hazy with a strong white foamy head, which recedes revealing a curtain of lace behind. Aroma, is noticable with citrus hops with some green 'earth-like' notes, and a waft of minor malt finish. To the tongue an orange citrus with a pine finish and some earthy tones, with a nice malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is mild to medium. Overall a nice welcome to the scene at least for a newbie to Caldera such as myself. Cheers","10: A: poured a caramel brown with a thin head that left a little bit of sticky lacing on the glass. S: at first I get caramel aromas with a underlying floral hop notes which had a good malt presence. There was also some citrus and bready notes as well. T: some nice piney hops pop out on the taste with caramel and citrus grapefruit accents that help out on the bitterness. It seems to have a decent malt backbone that helps out the balance. M: medium body with a low amount of carbonation that still works out but had a slight sweet and bitter hop finish. D: pretty good IPA that drank well and had a good amount of sweetness but lacked on the hop punch. It was still a tasty brew.","39: A can picked up in Baltimore. Pours a clear amber color with lots of foamy off-white head. Good retention leaves some spotty lacing. Smells of grassy hops, bread, caramel, and earth. Tastes of bread, toasted grains, caramel, lite citrus, and an earthy and grassy finish. Medium in body with good carbonation. Clean and smooth, malty and grainy with a nice bitter finish. Refreshing and easy to drink, a nice canned amber ale that I would definitely enjoy while out and about in the Summer time.","43: Had this on 2011-09-23 in Lynchburg, VA A - Almost clear, orange-amber with a 2-finger off-white head with big bubbles and moderate lacing. S - Fairly strong aroma that can be smelled 18\" away. Sweet malt, citrus and hop floral. T - Much like the aroma. Sweet bread and fruit followed by a dash of orange flesh a touch of spice and finally orange rind bitterness doesn't dominate. A pleasant, well-balanced bitter-sweet taste although it doesn't blow my hair back. M - Medium body and carbonation. A bit syrupy with some prickle O - I enjoyed this brew. It has a lot of flavor for being 6.1% ABV.","81: Thanks to hopdog for this... Appears a hazy, light orange with a small white head that fades into a mild collar and film. Spotty lacing is left around the glass. Smell is nice of citrusy hops, along with some notes of pine sap and herbs. Taste is of the mentioned aromas with caramel and citrus notes battling it out with a mild spiciness going on in the flavor. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, yeasty, sweet up front, and bitter on the end.","103: Pours a dark amber with a moderate head. Smell is pretty nice! Pine and tropical fruits. Taste starts with a nice blend of bitter pine and fruit punch, without being overly sweet. Pretty dry finish, medium-light mouth. This is a nice little surprise and drinkable but not complex enough to be interesting beyond one. But overall for what it is, Caldera has a winner.","121: A - Pours a clear light yellow with 3 fingers foamy white head. Lots of carbonation bubbles. S - Very nice malt aroma with floral and citrus hop aromas mixing nicely. T - Taste follows the smell with floral, citrus hop notes, mild bitterness, very rich caramel malt base. M - Light bodied, lots of carbonation, finish is all bittering hops. D - Good drinkability, very smooth and the flavors work well together.","124: I love the color of this beer. Can. It feels good to look at it. Smells like a can with some sticky green herbals inside. It tastes like sticky green goodness with just a pinch of grapefruit. medium bodied, with mellow carbonation that helps tickle the grainy and lemony finish on the roof of the mouth and middle of the tongue. This guy at work gave me one, and this other guy stole it, then the first guy gave me another one. Boy am I glad.","125: Thanks to Djeucalyptus for these! Poured from the can to a tulip. Fairly clear pale orange with a sticky, long lasting head. Lots of lacing. Fairly pungent resiny, piney aromas. Taste is very piney right away. Good hop bite and very crisp and clean feel. Just a great, easy drinking ipa- right up there with other great ones as far as drinkablity. Great beer!","144: Appearance. Slightly hazy, deep amber with a two finger, off-white head. Smell. Lemon and orange rinds with a little herbal earthyness Taste. Bitter pink grapefruit with a good hit of caramel malt, A little acrid on the tongue but turns into a nice bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel. Medium-strong carbonation. A little thin and a little warm alcohol. Drinkability. A good drinker. Seems a bit acidic, but a good long hoppy finish keeps me gulping this one down.","173: Very cloudy dark orange body is opaque. Two fingers of slighty rocky, mostly level white foam. Very piney aroma, with a bit of biscuit and a faint whiff of cleanser. Big swath of sweetness splatters across the tongue. Mix of hop tastes follows - grapefruit citrus, earthy, pine. Medium plus mouthfeel. Ok drinkability. An ok but unexceptional IPA or IIPA. No date to be found, so unless I encounter one I know to be very fresh, I won't be revisiting.","248: a: dark brown with amber highlights, no head or lacing. s: dark malts, medicine, little orange and rubbing alochol. t: malts, caramel, no medicine but dark fruits, other than bitters no other orange taste detected. m: full body with some bitterness. o: worth trying once, dont think i'll seek this one out again.","254: Pour was a surprisingly murky yet bright caramel color with an aggressive, sticky head. Big hops flavor up front - broadly bitter with floral and herbal notes, finishing up with a bit of pine resin. Substantial malt flavor, leaning toward caramel malt and a bit of toffee. Mouthfeel was almost chewy - no one will accuse this beer of being overly filtered.","272: Poured into a 1\u002f2 liter stein a deep rich amber\u002fbronze with a fluffy one finger head that took its time fading.Sweet smoke,brown,sugar,a bit of alcohol in the nose,mellow and sweetish,I found it appetizing.Cherry wood sweetness and light peppery spice in the nose,its gentle sweet smoke instead of in your face,mellow but assertive enough.A real nice smoked bock beer,I will grab a few of these this fall while eating alot of smoked meat off my smoker.","323: Cloudy, brownish amber. Medium, foamy, off-white head. Some carbonation and a touch of lacing. Earthy, floral hop aroma, some bready malts. Flavor has more earthy hops, lots of bready, grainy malt. Heavy-ish body but not sweet. A nutty aftertaste. Odd for a west coast IPA; not hoppy at all but not much malt flavor or complexity going on either.","329: 12 oz yellow can. It pours a clear amber with a soapy lookign white head. The smell is mediocre. There is some herbal character and some light citrus. The flavor has a nice bitterness, the flavor is pretty much jsut bitterness. Not a ridiculous amount, but it doesn't have much sweetness to balance. It is mostly piney. It is an odd one, doesn't bring much smell, but packs a nice flavor.","342: Poured a slightly cloudy deep amber\u002fred color with a thin soap ring of head. The smell is amazing, big bacony smoked pork Rauch goodness. The taste follows the flavors nicely with a big smoked malt flavor with a nice bit of underlying sweetness, very pork like and very flavorful. Has a nice light bitterness in the finish that helps even it out very well. The mouthfeel is very slick and oily. Great Rauchbier!","348: copper or amber in color. pretty clear with an off-white hop head forming on top. smells of pine up front and a hit of citrus zest toward the back. taste is refreshingly hopped. malty sweetness amongst the pine, resins, and citrus. mouthfeel is crispy with a slight bite. definetly drinkable.","360: A- black with thin tan head. Good lace S- sweet, slight hint of esters\u002ffruit, roasted malt...typical porter nose T- similar to nose. Initial slight estery\u002ffruitiness transitions smoothly to roasty-sweet, coffee\u002fchocolate finish. One of the best balances of hops-malt I've had in a porter. M- full bodied, silky and slightly creamy. Perfect for the style. D- very sessionable....very close to perfect for the style","373: 22oz bottle split into two large snifters Pours black with no head. Tiny quantities of bubbles drifting along in a lonely fashion. Smells like licorice and liquor. Taste is very pleasing. Licorice and coffee roasty malts mix together with some bitter burnt toast and nice malty sweetness for a very nice flavor. Mouthfeel is thick, a little gritty, slightly dry. Overall, forgiven for apparent flatness. It's good.","388: Poured from a can into my snifter. A - A clear golden orange, slightly burnt red color body with a medium frothy light white head. S - Very nice and big citrus hop smell that is smooth and sweet. Very pleasant. T & M & D - Great fruit sweetness up front that is refreshing and almost minty cool. Then some bigger malty sweetness on mid palate and the slight fruit acidity cleans the end and brings in some slight airy floral notes. The mouth is light and very drinkable, I go back to refreshing. O - Awesome IPA and I love the can. They really pull of the style well. One of my favorites that I come back to often. -Cheers","409: 12 oz. can tried 20 Jul 2009. Poured in the 0.5 L Adambrau becker. Extra large fizzy beige head. Light carbonation. Faintly hazy golden orange color. Citric and buttery toffee aroma. Grapefruit pithiness to start and throughout. Moderate caramel and toastiness. Somewhat buttery (A is ok with that in an IPA). Bittersweet lingering aftertaste. Moderate ethnanol. Medium body. Just don't like the butteriness in IPAs...","423: Light orange body under one finger slowly dissapating white head, exceptional lacing. Floral hops in the nose with light sweetness of malt, not too sweet. A very nice balance of grassy, grapefruit hops with delicate malty overtones on the taste buds. Nice carbonation in mouthfeel, and a very drinkable brew. A very pleasant surprise, looking forward to trying this in cans on a hot summer day.","426: Pours a reddish brown. Fairly clear with a bit of white head. Smells orange heavy and sweet dark carmels malts. Vry rich and dark . Brown sugar sweetness. Almost a burnt caramel on he tongue, the orange is not as strong as i would like. Thick and full bodied. Overall very nice compared to what I expected","440: Poured from the can into a tulip. Nice pour, perfect carbonation, nice medium head, solid lacing. Aroma is a perfect IPA balance of malt and citrusy piney hops. Taste matches aroma perfectly, this is a very balanced IPA. One weakness for me is the mouthfeel is the slightest bit thin. For all the flavor and aroma I would like it a bit \"chewier\". Very solid IPA.","446: A-Gold-light bronze. Big eggshell head. Brilliantly clear. S-Piney, citrusy hops. Crackers. Slight soapiness after a while. T-citrus rinds, some pine. Firm bitterness. Bitterness hides much of the malt but some crackery malt comes through. M-medium light bodied. Medium carbonation. No alcohol burn. really nice. D-Really nice beer. A bit on the bitter side to drink all night but a really tasty beer.","465: Golden yellow color. White, compact foam, quite creamy. Good appearance. Fresh smell, with good hop. Quite dry, with a good grassy note. Hay. Fresh and pleasant. More sweet in the mouth, with honey. The hop comes back in the end, and in the aftertaste. Not bad, but a bit too sweet for a pils. In the end some vanilla and camomile note. In the aftertaste, too. Though the hop, a bit too sweet. Honest.","491: Super clear orange body with a frothy sticky head that lasts the whole beer, very impressive appearance. Smells sweet, pine, citrus, biscuity, earthy. Taste is very malty with very little bitterness which i was not expecting as this is an IPA and should have more hop profile the taste. A little too malty for my liking.","552: A: Very pale golden color with pretty much no head whatsoever. S: Kind of weird but a little intriguing as well. Lots of rose petals and rose water here. Some faint hints of yeast and bread as well. T: Yeah, this isn't good. Lots of floral notes but there's no hint of the base beer here at all. A bit of a buttery note with some yeast, but that's about it. Mouthfeel is waaay thin and watery.","600: Faint sudsy head with some with some dissipating fine surface. Light ruddy brown. Some lace. Smokiness in the nose along with pickling vinegar (faint), and some slightly musty malt. Plenty of bitter, slightly tangy, tannic beech smoke. Traces of sweet toffee on the finish. Feel is standard, smooth, but went flat quite fast.","621: Appearance: Golden amber with the slightest haze and a nice sticky two finger head. Smell: Lots of signature cascade aroma - citrusy with a touch of pine. Taste & mouthfeel: Juicy citrus hop flavors supported by a dry biscuity malt backbone. Medium-light in body, crisp, dry. Moderate bitterness in the finish, though it doesn't linger too long. Very clean stuff, and incredibly drinkable. This reminds me quite a bit of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, but more raw and flavorful.","673: The beer looks ok in the glass. A bit hazy with a nice thick head. It smells like butterscotch with a hint of citrus. It tastes like butterscotch with a bit of hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is ok but I can't get past the butterscotch. Am I tasting diacetyl?","683: No Canned on Date A - Pours a rich amber color. Completely clear, with minimal head. S - Sweet hoppy syrupy smells. Hints of piney resin. T - Piney, resin, floral hops. No noticeable citrus qualities. Finishes very dry and bitter. M - Medium body with moderate to high carbonation. Just right for an IPA. D - Nothing I would go out of my to get again, but nothing I'd turn down either. This is a solid IPA. Not a lot to rant about, both positive and negative. The flavors are pretty one dimensional, bitter piney hops, no citrus undertones that I enjoy so much.","698: Appearance: Orange-amber with a slight haze to it. The eggshell colored head retains remarkably well, leaving a ton of sticky lace behind. Smell: Floral with a bit of resiny pine and grapefruit. Great hop aroma with no noticeable malt presence. Taste & mouthfeel: Malty but very dry. Floral and resiny hop flavors follow, leading way to a bitter finish with a hint of grapefruit. The medium-light body and restrained ABV make this one seriously drinkable IPA.","718: A - Poured out a clear, orange color with gold highlights. It had a foamy, fizzy, one-finger layer of white foam that left minimal lacing. S - It had a moderately grassy aroma with notes of orange. It also had a gentle caramel scent. T - It tastes of bitter grassy hops with a snappy, spice flavor. The ale also had a burnt toast maltiness. M - It was sharp and lively on the tongue. A light bodied pale ale. D - This is a pleasant tasting pale ale. It's nice to have a sessionable ale in a can.","741: I got this beer from Tilley4. Thanks Jason! 12oz can served in a standard pint glass. L - slightly hazed copper color with a bone white head that left trails of lacing. S - citrus rind and a slab of butter rolled in dirt. T - bitter citrus rind upfront with some buttery notes before getting dry and tart on the finish. F - medium bodied with a biting feel and smooth carbonation. D - goes down quick and easy.","748: Appearance: orange-copper, good clarity, spongey layer of yellowy foam that collapses to a thin cap Aroma: luscious, billowy bouquet of caramelly malt, cooked strawberries, and woodsy hops Flavor: medium-sweet malt backbone with a biscuity\u002fcaramelly note; scrunchy, grassy hop flavor with a mellow bitterness; finishes semisweet with a fresh-hop aftertaste Mouthfeel: medium-full body, gentle carbonation, smooth Other: Small batch? Do some bigger ones of this bad boy!","766: Pours amber, bordering on orange. Completely white, fluffy head. Pine sap and floral bouquet for aroma. Malt sweetness is also detectable in the nose. Taste is grassy, piny, spicy. Assertive but balanced, caramel malt is present. Big merit on drinkability, a simple and flavorful IPA. Finishes clean, nice and smooth. This would be a great \"every day\" IPA, but I guess, so would Pliny.","769: Pours out a clear, amber\u002forange with a 2-finger, thick, white head that leaves moderate, splotchy lacing. The smell is both fruity and malty, malt dominates. Taste is fruity, citrus hops up front then overtaken by a strong malt flavor and finishes with bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium, well-carbonated at first but low later. Drinkability is fine. I like it and many of those who like IPAs will also.","772: A: hazy pale orange. very fluffy white head. reasonable retention with better lacing. S: earthy, mellow hoppiness. bitterness dominates the aroma with a slight fruitiness. as it warms up, actually a nice sweet malt comes into play as well. T: slick, slightly metallic, hop bitterness. slightly doughy. more biscuit, dry finish. M: tingly carbonation on a medium body. D: sort of shocking that i have an APA from the west coast that isn't a hop bomb. not sure how i feel about that.","805: Sampled 10\u002f30\u002f11 - Transferring the notes. A ruby pour with a half finger, off white head. Opaque. Smells like bacon it's so smoky. Very much a wood smoked scent, great on an autumn night. The flavor is full but not overbearing, smoky with a hint of sweetness. I dig this a lot, will seek out other rauchbiers for some comparison.","808: It has a dark bronze and amber body. The head and lace are full, rocky and tan. The aroma is sweet but there is some yeast spice and little floral accents. It reminds me of a pale ale flavor a bit bitter, grapefruit like but has a sweet melon finish. The mouthfeel is medium. The carbonation had a lot of staying power.","812: Pours a hazy orangish amber with 1\u002f4\" of dense, foamy, white head that has great retention. The nose has notes of bready malt, pineapple, and grapefruit with a faint flora aroma. The taste is bready and malty up front with a nice blend of hop characters ranging from pineapple, grapefruit-citrus, and faint pine. The flavors are very well blended. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, well carbonated, and very refreshing. This is delicious and very easily drinkable. I could put away a lot of these especially since the bitterness from the hops isn't overpowering like in some IPAs so no diminishing returns here.","832: Hazy apricot color with a solid frothy eggshell colored head with great retention and lacing. Visible carb at the edges. Nice floral and grapefruit hop notes on the nose. Good clean flavors. Nice mild hop notes up front with the same characteristics as the nose balanced well with the middle-backended caramel maltiness. Hops create a slightly bitter aftertaste. Mouth is crisp with a bit of a zip and high carb. Overall it's a good pale ale. A perfect beer to have in a can like it is, being a perfect beer to have while camping, golfing, fishing etc.","858: From a can, pours straw gold with thick white head; aroma is pine and sugar, some citrus but mostly pine. Taste is fruity, citrus, tea, slight pine, toast grain. Mouthfeel is spot on, carbonation is medium, this brew is quite refreshing! Definitely something I wanna buy in quantity to go camping with this summer!","877: A - Pours a clear apricot orange. 1 finger sticky-looking head. Spotted lacing S - Bready caramel malt, honey, citrus hops, tea like cracker background. Very tasty. Honey malt aftertaste T - Honey caramel, spicy hops, green bark, slightly honey kissed floral, a slight earthiness\u002fmedicinal to the aftertaste. M - Perfect. The carbonation yields a sublime texture for the style. This is a good APA. However it does have some medicinal flavors that I'm not diggin.","880: A- Nice golden copper color. A thick foamy one finger head. S- A wonderful smell of sweet grapefruit is strongly coming through. T- The sweet taste didn't come though in the taste. The taste is a bit on the maltier side. The hops taste does give some DIPA's a run for their money. The hoppyness is very much there and it is good. M- The beer is smooth and easy in the mouth. A little drying of the tongue, but not too bad. D- Easy to drink, don't have to choke it down.","887: Decidedly crimson, clear, with just under a finger of slightly off-white head with lowish retention. Good citrus-Cascade nose, but not quite as strong as I would have expected. A straightforward, dryish, slightly caramelly amber ale with a good dose of citrus hop flavor. Nothing too complicated, and entirely pleasing, though I found myself yearning for just a little more malt in the background. I love it when hop juice becomes hop syrup...","922: Pours a pale golden hue with a substantial fluffy head that disipates within a minute or so. smell is quite appetizing sweet spicy malts with floral hopped background. tastes of spiced bread, warming alchole flavor floral hopes, nice and bitter. Very suprised bought this thinking it was going to be mediocor which its not at all. mouthful creamy coats the mouth flavor lingers just right. Drinkablity is good, ABV 5.4%","923: This is indeed quite tasty. The jet black color is very nice not very much light getting through this beer. The head is sticky and light brown. The hops are prominent along with a ton of roasted chocolate flavors and wood in the aroma and taste. The mouthfeel is semi thick, a little oily. The beer overall is really nice.","932: A - hazey orange in color with a rocky white head which quickly dissipates to a thin film. S - the nose is rich with hops. piney and fruity. sweet caramel malt notes and some cherry esters. T - clean, lightly sweet malt upfront followed by some piney bitterness and a long cherry\u002fsweetish finish. M - smooth, creamy, a touch watery and a full zippy carbonation. O - nice IPA with lots of piney notes but could've had a bit more bitterness on the tongue.","952: Golden amber with a big foamy head that just floats on top. Crisp pale malt and floral hop aromas. Flavors of light floral hops with a good malty reflection that combine to make a honey-like finish with a light hop linger. Medium carbonation with a non descript mouthfeel. It might not look like much but it tastes great although there's also not much to talk about in the mouthfeel. I really liked the honey I tasted in the finish.","976: 12 oz. can with a slightly different look from the one shown above. No freshness date Poured a bright, clear orange with a half-inch white head. Very subdued fruity aromas which quickly fade. This is the least impressive character of this ale. The ale begins with a pleasant bitterness that lingers on the tongue. There is a very faint metallic flavor that quickly faded. Overall, this is dry and refreshing. Noticeably carbonated with a light body. The mouthfeel is clean and refreshing. While not very complex, this is a summer quaffer with its light, refreshing body and slight fruity bitterness.","1002: Pours a clear burned orange with a creamy head that dies somewhat quickly and little to no lacing. Smells like a hop bomb with strong citrus, rind and a tiny bit of floral. Blows away your taste buds with hops and a bite of citrus. The balance isnt as great as it could be but this sure is tasty, especially if you are a hop head. Finishes wonderfully dry and bitter but doesnt linger too long on the tongue. Carbonation is perfect. A very drinkable and delicious IPA....and from a can no less.","1009: Pours a clear gold color, with a big impressive white head. Nice hoppy cascade nose. Floral, and pine like. Beer has a pretty light quality. But is still tasty. Light crisp hop flavor, a bit of malty sweetness and creaminess, and a slightly piney and resiny hop finish. Nice simple APA. Mouthfeel is pretty good. As mentioned, it's a bit light, but still feels nice in the mouth. Drinkability is very good. Light and easy drinking, yet still a tasty APA. Session worthy. I love canned craft beer!","1031: Tapped this open and a fruity piney smell, Cloudy golden orange color when poured in a pint glass. Nice foaming thick head. Big and hoppy, yet smooth as butter. Minimal hop after taste (I like this, so was a liittle disappointed with the lack there of there) However, a delicious beer. Would drink it anytime!! I bet on draft it is a delight!","1064: Poured into tulip glass. Appearance: Deep mahogany with red hue, pours 1 finger of off-white head that fades quickly. Lots of lacing. Smell: Roasted malt, chocolate, orange zest, slightly boozy as it warms, raw sugars. Taste: roasted malt, chocolate, blood orange, sweet, brown sugar. Mouthfeel: full bodied, good carbonation. Overall: A tasty porter. I like the subtle blood orange element. Not a lot going on here, but what there is is quite good. Drinkability is above average.","1073: Thanks to 5000 for sending this can my way. The beer pours a dark amber color with a white head. Darker than expected. The aroma is very nice. I get a lot of grapefruit and pine notes. The flavor is similar. The predominant flavor is some resiny pine from the hops but I also get some grapefruit. The toffee and caramel malt backbone balance out the beer nicely and keep the bitterness level fairly low for a west coast IPA. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very nice.","1096: Clear golden-orange color with small white head that laces well. Slightly sweet and spicy toasty grain with some floral and slightly woodsy and fruity hops. Lightly toasted and sweet fruity pale malts perfectly balanced by orangey citrus and floral hop bitterness that's a bit persistent. Nice light-moderate body that feels even easier due to the high, but no too stingy carbonation. Extremely drinkable Pale that I would definitely buy again.","1126: Poured from a can into a pint glass A - Amber in color with a thick, off-white head. S - Not as much hop aroma as I had hoped. There is some citrusy hop aroma and a bit of stickiness to it. T - better hop character in the taste. Good malt backbone to balance the hops. The finish is a bit chalky and biscuity. M - The biscuitiness interferes with the mouthfeel to me. A bit too thick on the tongue for an IPA. D - Nothing unpleasant about the way this one goes down. Alcohol is well masked and the carbonation level is right where it needs to be.","1137: Appearance: Pale golden pumpkin color with a 2 finger beige creamy head that looks like rocky whipped cream only not as bright white. Good head retention and lacing. Smell: Lots and lots of grapefruit from the hops. Extremely well done. Not overbearing but undeniably grapefruit rind goodness. Taste: Closer to a pale ale with a lot of grapefruit character. Not sure if its chinook hops or cascade that are being used here. Mouthfeel: A bit thin for my liking. Drinkability: Fairly easy to throw these 6.1 ABV cans back.","1143: Pours a bronze\u002famber color with a thick, creamy, fluffy white head. Dies down and leaves a lot of lacing along the side of the glass. Smell is highly, bitterly hopped. I think I can smell mt. hood hops, pine, black pepper, grass\u002fweedy smell, earthy. Taste is completely bittering with a smooth body. Black pepper in the taste, as well as that earthiness to it. Light carbonation brings out the slight malty flavors. Mostly though its pretty hoppy.","1145: Was pretty excited to see some limited 22's from Caldera down this way. Interesting art work on the bottle. A-ruby, brown almost a dark mahogany, small half finger head and translucent S-Orange, cherry and chocolate-Terry Chocolate Orange upfront, a faint grassy smell in the end T- light malts and belgian yeast. light orange and cherries with a slight bitterness on the end M-watery, light carbonation, not much body to it D-Overall, the taste was interesting but light, I wish it tasted as good as the smell was. There was not much body to this one for being a strong dark Belgian.","1152: A= basic blonde, mild white head, decent lacing. S= honey and floral hops notes. More evident as the beer warmed for a few minutes. T= immediately astringent and dry, somewhat watery, some florals, pine, bitters. M= astringent, some bitterness, florals. D= fine if you like it, depends on the price versus better APA offerings.","1162: Poured into a tulip glass. A light golden orange color. Very clear with almost 2 fingers of creamy rich pillowy head. This thing smells like candied hops. Lots of orange citrus covered in caramel. Tastes alot like the aroma only a bit on the lighter side. The citrus is there, the caramel is there and there is also a small amount of floral notes as well. Light to medium bodied with a crisp bitter finish. Overall this is an excellent canned IPA that i could drink all day long. Notes: Review taken from notes written on 5-25-10","1183: A: Deep apricot hue with a huge, beautiful, sudsy cream-colored head; lacing is great S: Lots of wonderful citrus from the hops: peach, mango, pineapple, lemon, grapefruit, and tea leaves with a slightly grassy and grainy malt undertone T: Hops are a touch more muted than aromas indicated but still plenty of citrus, tea leaves, pine, and weed F: Quite creamy upfront and finishing pretty well--though a touch thin O: A nice hop-forward IPA in a can, which you can never get enough of; something I'd like to try even fresher and something I will definitely come back to","1261: A: Poured a copperish orange color with good carbonation and a nice white head S: Caramel, bread, pine and light booze T: Taste follows nose pretty well. Balanced, with a good caramel and breadiness, floral and pine notes M: Nice lingering bitterness and sweet, sticky feel D: Good","1275: Pours a slightly hazy copper orange with a huge creamy white head. Huge floral and citrus nose with some bready malt notes. Flavor is dominated by Perfume\u002ffloral\u002fcitrus hop flavor, and a great bitterness to caramel\u002ftoasty malt profile. Moderate carbonation and creamy mouthfeel. This was delicious, thanks adamharbaugh for the opportunity.","1284: Clear orange-copper, or weak iced-tea in color with fine foamy covering that leaves some nice lace. Nice perfumy cascade-like aroma. Some citrus, pine and floral hops. Assertively hoppy. Lots of woodsy pine and some citrus peel. Kinda astringent bitter finish. Slightly stingy aggressive carbonation does not help the already astringent character of the beer. Pretty drinkable, despite the astringent impression.","1299: Amber with hints of orange with big tan foamy head with good retention and uneven lacing. Big citrus hop aroma. Big bitter grapefruit up frony with good caramel mellowing backbone. Smooth, silky feel with a low carb feel despite the big foamy head. A good overhopped IPA that's pleasant yet slightly one dimensional. Not worth $13.50\u002f6 pack unless you really need a good IPA in a can.","1303: Appearance: Pours a hazy, yellow-orange body with a thin, wispy white head. Smell: Aroma of herbal, citrus hops accompanied by a honey-laden maltiness. Taste: Mild pale malts with a bit of toastiness and a soft honey-like sweetness. Citrus and bitter herbs. Medium bitterness. Finishes dry. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Drinkability: A fair pale ale, but I gotta say I enjoyed the Caldera IPA far, far more.","1314: Red mahagonny. Yellow tinted head, thick full and dense, holds itself with stern authority. Sticky lacing also. Great hop aroma. Thick citrus fruit with berry components. A bready sweet malt really mends well with the abundance of fruit. Impeccably balanced. Nothing out of the ordinary necessarily but one of those brews that is just dead on. Bitter finish with fruit driven mid palate and a toffee core, all intertwined with dried berry puree. Nice and thick and drinkable.","1325: Clear light copper. Thick offwhite head. Decent retention. Nice tight laces. Pine, floral, citrus, and spicy hop aromas. Rich toasty, mild sweet caramel and a touch of vanilla. Crisp grapefruit, floral, pine, spicy resins. Toasty sweet caramel rolls in. Piney\u002fpeppery bitterness. Smooth, semi-rich medium body. good medium carbonation. Some drying and stickiness. Great canned IPA. Very drinkable and very tasty. Tailgating and camping and grilling favorite.","1353: Nice amber color and sticky white head. Light hop presence backed by a strong malt body and a bit of yeast. A bit flowery and sweet. Tastes solidly malty with a decent hop touch. A bit sour on the finish but otherwise not bad at all. Finishes smooth as well. Not bad, a more enjoyable amber and very nice looking to say the least.","1375: 12oz can into nonic. Crystal clear honey amber hue with a thick two finger head that seems to last forever. The malts are well hidden behind very aromatic piney hops. A little bit of honey is in the background. Though the hops are sharp, the seem slightly subdued. Toasty grains set the base, which linger throughout. The hops provide a citrusy and bitter flavor, with a little bit of lingering sweet fruit. Full bodied. This one seemed to disappear from my glass quickly. Very drinkable and well rounded. I like this one a little better than their Pale Ale, although both are good. Recommended.","1398: Poured from 12 oz can into pint mug: A - Dark golden amber in color. Clear, with nice 2 finger, off-white head. Excellent lacing on glass. S - Citrus,pine, grassy, malty. T - Golden malt at first; quickly followed by citrus and pine. Finishes fairly dry but leaves slight metallic aftertaste. M - Medium. Carbonation is very fine in character. D - As big as this is on flavor, I would have thought the ABV would be more than 6.1%. It's very drinkable; but at @ $14.006 pack it will have to be an occasional treat.","1404: Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Appearance: Pours a clear very dark redish amber with a finger of tan head that fades to a ring. Smell: Malty with some fruity notes along with mild chocolate and spice. Taste: More fruit here than in the smell. Malty and quite sweet, I'm picking up just a bit of the orange. The finish is malty and bitter. Mouthfeel: Medium body with prickly carbonation and a dry finish. Overall: Not as much citrus and I would have expected. I would have liked more fruit to go along with everything else. I would probably pass on this one in the future.","1449: A - Pours a hazy burnt orange. A billowy 3 finger head. Average lacing. S - Big citrus aroma, caramel, hints of alcohol, dried herbs. T - Citrus hops with some strawberry fruitiness. Some floral spice in the back fades into toasted caramel malt. The malt has a nice sweetness that keeps the hops from taking over everything. The malt seems shy at first but opens up as you go. My first IPA out of a can. Very easy drinking. Good stuff!","1487: A: Poured a nice golden color with good carbonation and a white head S: Floral notes, herbal, light booze T: Caramel, floral, even some biscuity notes at times M: Nice feel, crisp and a good drink D: Very good. Nice taste, very good West Coast take on a APA.","1514: A: Pale amber in color, beutifully clear, with a nice white head. S: Sweet caramel, a slight tropical fruit flavor with a hint of pine wood. T: Sweet fruit flavor at first, followed by a nice tropical hops flavor. A bit of a malt in the back, but the hop flavor dominate. Not too bitter, just pleasantly hoppy. M: Medium bodied, slightly chewy, perhaps a little over carb'd D: Very good overall, but I would like to see a little more balance from the malty side. I think the hop profile is dead on.","1521: Reddish copper with pumpkin highlights and a dense cream and orange head of foam that leaves sticky lace on the glass. Citrusy and minty C-hops with plenty of caramely malt. It must be the can, the hop fresh flavors are off the charts with plenty of juicy grapefruit and orange backed with enough caramel malt to balance but still be hop forward. Medium bodied with prickly carbonation. A really nice session IPA.","1527: A golden orange and slightly fizzy brew with a slight fluffy off-white head that constricts slowly instead of outright fading away. A few minuscule dots of lace line the glass. A note of citrus hops is noticed on the nose at first, then a slight caramel sweetness follows up. Melon rind, a squirt of lemon on the tongue, some graininess in the background, and a drop of honey makes for a happy palate. Light to medium bodied with crisp edges. Cohesion is bliss.","1546: Deep dark orange in color with a one-finger tan head which lingers a second then drops away leaving a few small specks of lace. Sweet malts and oily hops rise pleasantly to the nose. Some subtle pine is mixed in. Tastes of bright fresh citrusy hops and the malt backbone does it's job evening things out well. Not as big on the hops as many other IPA's, but being that it comes in the can this one begs to be taken to the lake or to the beach as it has just enough taste to keep things interesting, and the fact that it's in a can is fookin' cool.","1564: Dark red color, light beige foam, average. In the smell malt and caramel, not really light. Again malt and caramel in the taste, not bad in the end. Maybe a note of honey in teh back, and a light fruitiness. Average body. In the aftertaste a light bitterness, with the malt and red fruit. Nothing exceptional, but not bad, drinkable beer.","1565: Appearance - This is a dark malty brownish-bronze in color with a good, off-white head that pitted well. Smell - The pine and citrus here is very tight and wrapped in a malty toasted base. The hops are very raw and fresh. Taste - The malt gets bigger at the taste but the hops are still, well, hopping. The malt adds some sweetness here, maybe caramel, and the pine actually seems bigger as well which is the exact opposite of most every other AIPA. Mouthfeel - This is medium-bodied with some bitterness but nothing heavy. The carbs are very light but well done. Drinkability - This is a quality but uneventful drink. You won't impress anyone by serving this but you won't disappoint.","1589: Pours a deep gold with a 2 finger head that dissipates to a fine layer, leaving lots of sticky lacing on the glass. Floral hoppy aromas, salty biscuits, and a whiff of ginger. Malty biscuit flavor, then a strong taste of bitter greens\u002fgreen pepper, with a lingering grapefruit finish. Hops are a bit numbing on the tongue. Body is light and the carbonation is enough to give this a moderately creamy mouthfeel. Eminently drinkable beer, for those who like their IPAs with a bitter green hop taste.","1626: Pours a crisp clear pale gold color with a small head that dissipates rather quickly. Has a bitter hoppy pine and citrus smell. Very pungent for a APA. Bitter bite hits right away and fades to a smooth caramel malty biscuity flavor. Not very complex, but good tastes none the less. A very light smooth beer. Very sessionable could def hammer a few of these back.","1627: HOPS! If you like a hoppy beer, this is for you. Pours a golden brown with a nice foamy head. Complex flavors keep you interested with citrus and fruity notes. Just enough maltiness to keep the hops from being completely overwhelming. Aroma is strong with fruity citrus notes as well.","1649: A: Poured a hazy amber color with a nice white cap S: Faded piney hops, caramel T: Caramel and faded hops battle for dominance while the metallic and old Earthy notes fight for second place. Bad. M: Medium to full body and not one I would recommend hiolding on your palate O: Poor IPA, drainpoured after two sips","1682: poured into a tulip from a can with a two finger head and a deep copperish golden color with a slight reddish hue. smells like a slight twinge of alcohol and a floral yet citrusy hop aroma. and a sugary sweet malt backbone. Taste is bitterup front with a citrusy tongue with a sweet malt finish. relly quite impresive for my first craft beer from a can. super complex and tasty as hell. Mouth is suprisingly clean with a bite in the front. drinks moderately and really suprised me. For the cost I can't say it's worth it. 14.99 a six pack is steep for this one but it is a damn fine beer.","1695: A lot of foam. But a lot. In the smell some banana, and then lactic and tart. Not a good start. Quite dark orange in color, with a lively carbonation (now visible, under the foam). Again tending to lactic sourness. Same for the taste. With some yeast and banana.","1697: appearance - light amber color, just a little darker than I expected from the nose, big frothy head. Smell - very nice hop, pine, some fruit taste - nice hoppy grapefruite taste, dry finish mouthfeel - very even, not too thin, not too chewy for a single ipa overall - solid, I doubt I will pay $12.99 again for this brew and it probably factored into my rating","1707: Aroma is absolutely heavenly - smoky with firm tones of quality coffee, molasses and sweet chocolate and a hint of licorice. It pours a deep, rich, warm opaque sable with a thick dark tan head that leaves some good lacing. Mouth filling flavor has a decided mocha core, quality coffee and chocolate plus licorice, molasses and even a bit of hoppy bitterness. Smooth flavor has a firm and biting fizz, and it leaves a smoky, slightly bitter, tingly finish. If ever you are in Oregon, grab a bottle - or better yet, grab two or three so you have something to trade.","1709: Exceptionally pale yellow with vigorous carbonation, a light white head, fogged body, and full abstract lace. This simple session lager has a sustained head, a light appealing aroma, and enough Saaz to keep your feet tapping. Could use a catchier name though. Served on tap at the Siskiyou Pub, Ashland, OR.","1729: Orangeish with a peach head. Smell was hoppy. Taste was hoppy, not alot else going on. Not exciting but not boring either. It was easy to swallow but not alot else. Its something I could drink a few of. Good if you want a session beer but don't want a strong flavor.","1738: More of a 'dry' than a lager, tasted at the 2002 Oregon Brewers Festival. Orange color, orange flavor in nose. Light malts and fairly aggressively hopped; yet it is not very bitter. Interesting taste, complex and subtle. Light yet flavorful. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Nice beer. Would be a great beer to sip during a hot summer day.","1753: Pours out a pale straw like color with a bubbly 2 finger deep white head. Smells of light flowery Cascade hoppiness, pine, spruce, tropical. Flavor is soft bisquity maltiness, piney hops, faint caramel sweetness, earthy tone, nicely balanced. Crisp, clean, light to medium bodied, lingering bitterness. Highly drinkable. excellent summer session brew. Should be a campsite\u002fcooler standard.","1773: 12oz can courtesy of Unclejedi, thanks! nice orange color with a foamy, sticky white head. Smells hoppy, resin, catty, nice. The taste is nicely balanced with the hops not really taking over just blending in to the picture. The mouthfeel is very smooth. Another example of good beer in a can.","1831: A-Pours an orange\u002famber color with a dense, pillowy, white, one finger head. S-Grapefruit, pine and mango with some pineapple and light carmale notes. T-Bitter pine, pineapple, some grapefruit with light malt and a dry bitter finish. M-Pretty crisp and dry in the mouthfeel with medium body and pirckly, but low carbonation. D-Really nice IPA. It has most of the things that I look for in an IPA: some malt backbone, a nice bitter hop burst and a great fragrant nose.","1849: Complex enjoyable smoked. Tasty rich malt,caramel, woody,spicey, and balanced. Leans a tad to sweetness rather than bitterness. The smoke is significant in the aroma but not overwhelming. Above average mouthfeel. Yellow coloured body. Most drinkable.Thanks Augustgarage.","1850: A: pours amber orange with a decent finger of off white head. S: grapefruit and light pine, and floral hop. There is some malt sweetness in the background. T: a nice tounge coating hop, that is piny, a citrus cross between grapefruit and orange. Malt is light but nicely sweet. M: coating hop, though the malt is light in the mouth, good carbonation. O: canned beer is really starting to grow on me, and leaves me impressed enough to try calderas other offerings","1856: Sampled from a can with no freshness date. Big billowy off-white head with decent retention. Burnt orange in color. Medium bodied with an oily feel and aggressive carbonation. Solid caramel malty aroma with a hint of citrusy grapfruit hop flavor near the finish. Orange citrus flavores up front that transitions to bitter pine hop flavor that quickly follows thru the middle and to the finish. Noce caramel malt undertone throughout. Decent hop character and balance but lacked the hop intensity of a really goof IPA.","1863: Ruddy read pour with 2 fingers of cream head. Great retention and thick strands of lace. Floral hop nose. Woody, earthy mix. Bread malt thrown in for good measure. Taste is hop esthers, with light resin and oil. Also a surprise with a taste of strawberry licorice. Thick, chewy body for the style. I'd get this again.","1871: Poured from the can a clear golden hue with two fingers of bright white head. Good lacing all around. Aroma is slightly sour and malty much like a pilsner. A slight whiff of sulfur and vegetables as well. The taste has a bitter edge along with malt and biscuit. Lighter bodied, dry, and moderately carbonated. Pretty drinkable, but this is a fairly decent pale ale that sits in the middle of the pack.","1893: Smell is light, almost non-existent, must be trapped in the dark amber. Very light head tops a thin effervescent surface. Taste is belgian yet bitter, with very little of the promised oranges. I'm getting a lot of roast out of this, which normally would be a compliment but it just doesn't fit what I was expecting. Aside from the bitter notes the beer is pretty good, it's almost like a belgian strong dark coffee stout ale.","1910: Amber brown in color with very little head but a nice ring. Nicely carbonated. Smells like a camp fire, malts have a good sweet character with an abundance of smoke. Taste is quite good with smokiness being pungent but not overwelming. A sweet tasting bock with smokiness coming through around mid drink with a smooth mellow finish. A good warming smoky beer.","1933: A- is cloudy and light glassy goldeness S- smell of light winter pine needles and small delicate floral hints T- the taste is light and easy to drink, very winter like in the beginning. Reminds me of being in a forest and then at the end your hit with small hints of flower flavor. M- easy to the tounge and flows with 2 waves of flavor. Both are easy and satisfying. O- this is a very unique beer and I would recommend it to any one for a very different drinking experience. It easy and I would drink this beer in the winter or spring. Its very light and still has a pretty high alcohol%.","1940: Reddish amber with good clarity. Modest head that leaves light lacing. Pretty color, but fairly unusual for an IPA. Pleasant nose but more malty than hoppy - graham cracker maybe? Herbal hop character with moderate lingering bitterness. A bit metallic. Medium bodied. A bit juicy but metallic bitterness builds to dominate the impression.","1960: Pours a pale straw gold with a frothy light 2 finger head. Decent retention. Good lacing. Nice carbonation. Nose is faint, with pine and light citrus coming through. Slightly yeasty. Very sharp on the tongue. Bitter, but more than hops contributing to this aspect of the flavor. Odd that the bitterness tends to fade before the taste does.","1976: Nice light orange\u002famber color with lots of head. Big pine and grapefruit nose that screams bright hop flavor will follow, and it does. Taste follows the nose with big grapefruit notes that are followed by tangerine, pine, and maybe a slight pineapple at the end. Malt is light, slightly sweet, and lets the hops shine through very nicely. Not aggressively bitter but bitter enough to make you sip it a little slower, not offensive at all. Very drinkable, nicely priced, and always available where I am, making this one a regular for me.","1354: 22 oz bottle from Fred Meyer, N.Salem store. $5.19 Darker than the typical IPA..almost amber beerr with a large thick and frothy cream coloured head. Aroma seems balanced between resiny hop and nice toasty malts. Again the taste is balanced with nice caramell,toasted hops blancing a nice resinous hop bite..lasting after bitterness. Quite nice and thick for style on the palate. Overall i liked this one more than i thought i would.","74: 12oz can poured into a pint glass. Pours an orangish amber color with a sticky off-white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. The aroma features a good dose of toasted and biscuity malt with some piney hops. The taste is sweet malt up front with a lingering piney hop bitterness in the finish. Overall, Caldera IPA is another solid PNW IPA that packs the hops. Recommended.","102: 12 oz bottle poured into Sam Adams glass. Good head and lacing, pours a deep amber. Aroma is citrus piney hops, with a bit of toffee. Taste has a great hop profile, bitter piney yet plenty of flavorful citrus fruit as well. Dry finish, medium viscosity. Overall a very nice west coast style IPA.","120: 12 oz. can into duvel tulip glass appearance: looks good ruby\u002forange\u002fstrawlike color with some heavy headiness, definitely dissipating though, doesnt look too carbonated smell\u002ftaste: smelling some fruitiness and some hops also and some malty balanced undertones. the taste is hoppy and not overbearing, kind of not full bodied enough. a different one this is mf: not really slick or thick just a runny ipa drink: could drink a few my first offering from caldera, ill have to try some more flavors","281: Received this can through Beer Powerball. I am really sorry that I don't know who sent it, my brother is keeping those records, but THANK YOU!! Pours with a nice half centimeter white fluffy head on a glass of dark straw-colored beer. Smells of citrusy hoppy goodness and oddly, a little like soap. Mouthfeel is very pleasant as is taste. This is a nice drinking beer. It's not blow you away with over-the-top flavor. It's a well-balanced, highly drinkable and enjoyable brew. I'm glad to have gotten the chance to try it.","312: This bottle was hand delivered from my brother who lives in Portland, OR. The beers pours a deep burnt orange color with a small white head. Very nice lacing on the glass. The dominant smell is of sweet caramel. Taste is also sweet caramel with a strong earthly, almost dirty, hop finish that hangs! A decent beer, but much more malty than I would expect from a beer called Hopportunity Knocks.","327: Served from can into a Delerium Tremens tulip. Pours a hazy red-orange with a one finger off-white head that slowly subsides to minimal. Maintains decent lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt, hops, and pine. The flavor was of malt and a load of hops. It was medium on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a very nice IPA from a can no-less. Definitely worth seeking out if you are an IPA fan as it is quite drinkable and enjoyable. I will be having another in the near future.","407: 12oz can. Poured a medium amber color with an averagd sized off white head. Aromas of pine, earthy, floral, and citrus. Tastes of pine, citrus, and some caramel. Nice grapefruit bitter finish. A vert nice IPA and from a can too! Notes from: 09\u002f14\u002f07.","660: Can from Beerzack. Thanks! Pours Semi-clear reddish amber witha big lasting chunky whitish head that leaves lots of lacing. Smell is sweet fruity, fresh and hoppy. Very nice. Taste is smooth with fruity caramel and fresh citrusy, and sweet orange flavored hops and bitter citrus rind. Nice and strongly bittered which lasts in the finish but with a light lingering sweetness too. Very good IPA.","683: No Canned on Date A - Pours a rich amber color. Completely clear, with minimal head. S - Sweet hoppy syrupy smells. Hints of piney resin. T - Piney, resin, floral hops. No noticeable citrus qualities. Finishes very dry and bitter. M - Medium body with moderate to high carbonation. Just right for an IPA. D - Nothing I would go out of my to get again, but nothing I'd turn down either. This is a solid IPA. Not a lot to rant about, both positive and negative. The flavors are pretty one dimensional, bitter piney hops, no citrus undertones that I enjoy so much.","713: nice burnt orange with a white head that holds fairly well and leaves very pretty lace. nose and taste consist of piney, citrusy and maybe peachyish hops with a caramelly backbone. decent mouthfeel, a little thicker would be good for me, but there is no doubt this is a first class ipa. tons of competition keep the ratings down, but i could knock these back all night and be in sweet hophead bliss the whole time.","722: Nice dark orange colured ale, small lightv tan head. I dont like the aroma, it certainlly has hops aplenty, but has a sour ,sweaty work sock aroma that puts me off in the background. The flavor is better, very strong oniony hopping, pink grapefruit and spruce tips. Thin and maybe even a tad under carbonated. I dint really dig this one. I liked their Pale Ale way better.","778: 12 oz can poured into duvel snifter A - pours a deep amber, very lively, large white head that stays for a bit, very good looking beer S - huge citrus notes, absolutely amazing smelling beer T - amazing citrusy grapefruits and oranges amazing IPA, absolutely, the bitterness is perfectly balanced M - very smooth, creamy, easy to drink O - the best IPA I have ever had, absolutely amazing beer","856: 12oz can $2. I did not care for this beer. It looked good, orange, pale, good lace, decent head. It smelled kind of weak but not bad. It tasted like stale iced tea and I did not care for that flavor one bit. The IPA I had from this brewer was much better than this. For my money I'd stick with Full Sail Pale Ale for a couple dollars less.","891: A - pours an amber color with a two finder head that is retained for a good 5-10 minutes. The beer is almost as clear as a lager...not cloudy at all. S - very strong citrus smells. T - similar to the smells, the first predominant taste is citrusy. After that, you get a hint of caramel. Then the hops come through and leave a nice bitterness finish. D - I love this IPA. It's one of my favorites! It's exactly how a west coast IPA should taste. The only issue could be a slight lack in carbonation.... But I find that true of most craft can beer I try.","901: Pours a nice golden peach color with a frothy long lasting ivory head. Smells of earthy grassy hops and a little citrus. Great tasting with plenty of bitterness and some grapefruit. Just enough of a malt backbone to let those grassy hops shine. A medium-bodied and flavorful IPA available in a can that reminded me of a nicer version of 60 min. If the price point were lower, I'd drink this a ton.","910: Had to get this one for the name, Grabbed a bottle when I came across it at the store. The pour was a murky orange brown color with a fluffy tan colored head on it. The smell of Belgian yeast was prominent, along with some citrusy aromas and earth too. The taste of the beer had some sweet notes up front with the fruits and brown sugars that might be in there. The finish was a little on the dry and spicy side. The mouthfeel I thought was just a little thin. Overall the beer was worth the try for sure. I would probably buy this one again in the fututre.","911: My main man woodychandler comes through with yet another canned beer for me to try. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a orange\u002fbrownish color with a 1\u002f2 inch head. Smell is very hoppy, not much else. Taste is also all hops, dry and bitter, not much else coming through. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer.","981: 22oz bottle into snifter. 2011 vintage. from notes. Pours black with a thick mocha colored head that dissipates fairly quickly. The aroma is of cocoa, with roasty malts. I can just barely pick up notes of the licorice. The taste follows the nose fairly well. Cocoa mixed with astringent coffee, though the licorice is more pronounced then in the aroma. The mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied with subtle carbonation. This was quite drinkable, and left me a very good impression of the brewery.","995: 12 oz. can, A: Pours amber, nice finger sized white head, good head retention, solid lace, nice look all around. S: Oranges\u002fSimcoe, tropical fruit, pine, a very pretty smell, but understated, could be great. T: Heavy citrus dominates - orange, tangerine, grapefruit, pine in the finish. Like the Pale, the malt is very light, I like the hop profile a lot more in this one as compared to the Pale. M: Soft carbonation - perhaps from the can, medium-bodied. D: Pretty standard Northwest IPA, a fine drinking beer, not going to wow you.","1035: Serving type- 12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass. A- Pours a pretty deep orange color with a nice lacing. S- Huge notes of citrus: grapefruit and orange. T- A good tasting IPA. Nice even bitter hoppy flavor throughout. Can't taste any alcohol which makes for an easy drinking beer. This is a good West Coast IPA but it is lacking a little when compared with other beers of the same style and region.","1072: Can from K&L Redwood City. A - Pours a bright medium amber color with a two-finger, lasting off-white head and good lacing. S - Aroma is piney and citrusy hops, a touch of sweet malt, and tropical fruits. T - Flavor is a little pale and caramel malt, but mostly showcases a complex hop profile, with pine, pineapple, orange, and grapefruit. Pretty harshly bitter, although I like that of course. M - Crisp palate with medium body and carbonation. D - Solid. Overall this is the best canned IPA I've had after Surly Furious.","1073: Thanks to 5000 for sending this can my way. The beer pours a dark amber color with a white head. Darker than expected. The aroma is very nice. I get a lot of grapefruit and pine notes. The flavor is similar. The predominant flavor is some resiny pine from the hops but I also get some grapefruit. The toffee and caramel malt backbone balance out the beer nicely and keep the bitterness level fairly low for a west coast IPA. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very nice.","1082: Found this on vacation at the piggly wiggly in Myrtle Beach, SC. What a pleasnt treat \u002fsuprise!Tasted great even right out of the can.Appeared to have a deep golden color kind of darkish. Smelled nice and hoppy and fruity small bit of floral.Taste was straight up IPA wich is a great thing in my book.Mouth was smooth and pleasant with a nice amount of hops bitterness.These babies have a drinkability that is very nice,went down real nice in the heat and the cans were a big plus for transportation.Wish this brew was around my area!!!!","1136: A- Pours a nice amber color with a whit head. S- Hops with a citrus tone hint of malt. T- Hops and citrus tones with a hint of a malt finish. M- Semi dry with hop flavors through out sip and a malt finish. D- Pretty good beer from Oregon. I can drink this again with no worries. Cheers...","1155: A: In a pint glass. Clear amber, nice yellowish head. S: Piney, citrusy hops. Malty, bready, herbal. T: Like smell. Bitter. I like this. MF: Like most beers for me, not remarkable; standard for the style. D: Very drinkable. It's a little pricey and only sold by the can. But if it were cheaper\u002fsold in 6 packs here I'd definitely pick up a sixer.","1211: 22 oz bottle from \"Lifesource\" Salem. $3.95 Nice golden clear beer body with a nice sized frothy\u002fcreamy white head. Ok aromas..mainlly a bit of ginger speice and some bready malt..simple nice Taste very nice indeed..nice spicy ginger backed with slightly caramel maltiness..simple again but i like . Liked the mouthfeel of this one..very forward carbonation which helps the ginger effect and a lingering ginger in the after taste. Overall a simple ginger brew .I liked it","1215: Poured from a 12 oz can into a pint glass. Pours a hazy copper color, with a very small head. Not much lacing. The aroma is very hop forward, notes of citrus. Everything good about the nose gets ramped up a notch in the taste. Huge grapefruit and orange flavors, good malt backbone and a really nice hop finish. Medium bodied, carbonation is good. An incredibly drinkable IPA, will definately seek out again!","1276: Poured from a 12oz can into a nonic. Thanks to BA redbird. This brew pours a cloudy golden-amber color crested with two fingers of head that retains well and leaves great lacing. The smell is great. Hops, grapefruit, and some caramel malts. A normal IPA nose, but done well. The taste is that of a well-done, well-balanced IPA. The malts and hops are quite harmonious, neither taking over too far. There's some ever present grapefruit here as well. The aftertaste does bring in a great deal of hop resin over malts. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both solid. Just a well-done IPA.","1290: Great looking 12oz can poured into pint glass. Pours a golden amber color with tons of frothy head and gobs of lacing on the sides of the glass. Very piney hoppy smell. Taste is a slap in the tongue with pine followed by orange citrus. Amazing hop profile on par with super hopped double\u002fimperial IPA's. Light dry mouthfeel that really dries out your mouth. Great drinkability hindered only by the hop blast that will quickly leave your taste buds dulled. Overall this is an amazing IPA that blows my mind every time I drink it.","1299: Amber with hints of orange with big tan foamy head with good retention and uneven lacing. Big citrus hop aroma. Big bitter grapefruit up frony with good caramel mellowing backbone. Smooth, silky feel with a low carb feel despite the big foamy head. A good overhopped IPA that's pleasant yet slightly one dimensional. Not worth $13.50\u002f6 pack unless you really need a good IPA in a can.","1320: I had this on tap last in August of 2009 at Bailey's Taproom in Portland, Oregon. The colour was a very dark brown with a garnet base and a thin tan head. The aroma was full of coffee, roasted malt and chocolate. On the palate, there was light CO2, day old coffee, some dark chocolate and more roasted malt.","1331: 12oz can poured into a pint Pours a hazy golden color with a fluffy white head. Some nice staying power and spider web lacing. The aroma is musty and earthy with layers of pine and orange. On the palate, this guy is a little more pine and citrus forward while the earthy, musty hops come through in the middle. The finish is earthy bitter with a touch of pine resin. Light medium body with good carbonation. This is a nice pale ale that deserves a spot in any rotation. Borderline sessionable.","1347: 12oz can. A) Pours with a tight, creamy head. Takes a bit to settle. Hazy body, amber in color. Sticky lacing. S) Piney. Grapefruit. Caramel. T) Well balanced flavor combination. Caramel. Orange. Starts a little bit bitter then moves right into the malty sweetness. Finishes with a hop bit and subtle spruce and alcohol. M) Crisp up front then smooths out. Medium body. D) A well crafted brew. I'd definitely drink another one.","1375: 12oz can into nonic. Crystal clear honey amber hue with a thick two finger head that seems to last forever. The malts are well hidden behind very aromatic piney hops. A little bit of honey is in the background. Though the hops are sharp, the seem slightly subdued. Toasty grains set the base, which linger throughout. The hops provide a citrusy and bitter flavor, with a little bit of lingering sweet fruit. Full bodied. This one seemed to disappear from my glass quickly. Very drinkable and well rounded. I like this one a little better than their Pale Ale, although both are good. Recommended.","1479: A - pours a deep rust orange with 1\u002f4 inch of white foam S - citrus and hints of piney hops T - slightly citrus hops with a major piney hop kick at the end, not overpoweringly bitter, just a really tasty treat M\u002fD - medium bodied and decent carbonation, definitely a nice IPA that I could have several of","1480: Got this in a 22 ounce bomber. It poured a deep bright brown with a pretty small head. Aromas of smoked kielba, and dark roasted malts. This beer was OK but for a style that I like so much it did'nt really please as much as I thought it would. It had a nice amount of smokiness to it. Really obvious and pretty strong but not charred. But the oily consistency of the beer along with the huge saltiness made the beer less than I was hoping for. It was still a beer that I'm glad I grabbed. They don't make many in the style anyways.","1658: First micro brew for me in a can. Cool logo but with no freshness date. It pours a amber color with a nice sea foam head. The smell is strong of hops. The taste hits you with a dry hop appeal with a huge hop profile. It leaves a stinging pleasant aftertaste as it journeys down the throat. I really like the uniqueness of the this American IPA profile.","1666: 22oz bottle A- Pours a hazy amber color with an off-white head with decent retention and lacing. S- The aroma is sweet malt and some citrus notes from the centennial hops as well. The aroma is good, but a little more subdued than I was expecting. T- The taste like the aroma is smooth and malty up front with the hops coming in and lingering well into the finish. M- The mouthfeel is light bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. D- Overall, I enjoyed Hopportunity Knocks but I isn't a beer I would likely seek out again. Worth a try.","1690: Consumed 11\u002f4\u002f10 Got in a trade from ILikeBrew, thanks Micah for some Pacific Northwest Beer! Poured into Alchemist Brewery pint glass A: Pours clear dark orange with an inch of soapy head. Hangs to the glass pretty well to the bottom. S: Caramel malts, grapefruit, some pine resin T: Mild fruit up front, then the caramel\u002ftoasted malts in the middle. Finishes dry and bitter, nice punch. F: Slightly less than medium, with lower carbonation than I'd prefer. D: Pretty low carbonation for the big IPAs I'm used to drinking, so I could definitely do a few of these in a night.","1693: 12oz can courtesy of Reino poured into a pint glass. Pours a clear light golden with a decent creamy white head that hung on as a cap for a while leaving good lacing. The aroma is very light with lots of lemony hops up front and a bit of bready malts as well. The flavor had the light citrus up front with the malts in the middle before giving way to some faint pine hop bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated and lighter than most pale ales. This is a very drinkable pale that doesn't have too much differentiation but is still tasty.","1697: appearance - light amber color, just a little darker than I expected from the nose, big frothy head. Smell - very nice hop, pine, some fruit taste - nice hoppy grapefruite taste, dry finish mouthfeel - very even, not too thin, not too chewy for a single ipa overall - solid, I doubt I will pay $12.99 again for this brew and it probably factored into my rating","1737: A 12 ounce can from a sixer I picked up at Abe's for $11. Poured into my Ithaca shaker glass. The IPA appears a super clear golden amber color with about a finger of off white foam. The head leaves a nice looking lace in its wake. Nose and flavors consist of bready, caramel malt, perfume, a bit of bitter grapefruit pith, lime, lemon, lightly toasted rolls. Medium bodied with adequate carbonation. I thought this would be super fresh and hoppy since this brewery just came into PA a week or so ago. I was a bit let down, especially judging by the reviews here. Needs more hops...","1801: Purchased in Portland during my spring break Pacific Northwest trip, the only bottle offering I've had from Caldera. Poured is a orange hued color. This IPA tastes maltier than the ones I used to have. Drinking at near room temperature made this even maltier-tasting, which isn't necessarily bad, but to me it tastes more like an amber than an IPA. It's a good beer but not outstanding.","1816: This has recently hit the NC market...in reading reviews I' puzzled at the reviews. This is an AWESOME IPA...simply awesome. Appearance is great, cloudy with a very decent 2\" head. Smell is fresh hops and malt...more hops than malt. Taste is mostly all grapefruit hops...I love it. Right next to G'Night (Gordon) as the best beer from a can...I gave my son a can and even his collage buddies who don't like IPA's said it was amazing. The price point is a little high ($13 for a sixer) in NC but I love this brew.","1821: 12 ounce can. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a hazy amber color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention is pretty good, and there is a lot of lacing left behind on the glass. Aroma is herbal and citrusy hops, along with a bit of sweet malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, it's mostly hops with some sweet malt noticable too. There's also a nice lingering bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel\u002fbody is medium, it's slick with moderate carbonation. It's easy enough to drink. I think it's a good solid IPA. I'd buy this one again in the future.","1825: Review is from notes. Picked this up while visiting family in pennsylvania. A: Dark yellow, good head, great pour S: Hops, sugar, some floral T: Bitter up front, malt balances nicely M: A bit bubbbly for my taste. Needs a little less carbonation D: Ok. Not the best pale ale but decent.","1846: Bought a 6 pack at my local grocery store. Poured into a stone nonic. A very pretty and pretty tastey IPA. Comes through with some thick texture and dark fruit flavor initially and transforms into juicy hops finishing with a tad of extreme bitterness. A really well rounded, perfectly B+ IPA that is very cost effective if you're looking for something to knock a few back of and enjoy.","1859: Thanks to bman1113vr for sharing this bottle. The beer pours a clear brown color with a tan head. The aroma is heavy on the toffee and not too much else. The flavor is toffee, leather, tobacco, wood and dark fruit. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A decent beer but nothing too exciting.","1861: Purchased from Midtown Wine & Spirits in Nashville. I love that this is a quality IPA in a can! It pours a somewhat hazy caramel color and is loaded with hops. I though it had hints of grapefruit and was well balanced. This beer was easy to drink and I really enjoyed it.","1905: Clear dark amber with a good three finger white head. Plentiful lacings. Aroma is fruity citrus hops with a bit of leather. Taste is full deep leathery bitter hops with the correct amount of malts. The label describes \"centennial hops\" as the mainstay of all that bitterness. Mouthfeel is just right, and drinkability is very good for this style. Kudos to Caldera for daring to bottle a limited production beer. Their normal regimen is cans. Cool label. Give the fellows from the \"State of Jefferson\" a big thumbs up! Keep it coming Caldera!","1705: A: Slightly hazy copper color with a slight off-white head and pretty intense lacing. S: Pine hops and a lot of caramel malts. T: Pretty fair balance between the hops and malts. Nice amount of hops upfront and then a lot of bready malts with a slightly burnt flavor to them. Crisp and pretty easy to drink. Without a doubt the best IPA I've ever had from a can.","8: Pours a nice copper \u002f amber with a medium tan lasting head and nice lacing. Aroma of earthy piney hops, followed by some caramel malt and nice fruity bouquet. Taste is resiny earthy piney hops with some nice caramel maltiness and light fruity notes. Palate is nice crisp medium body with good carbonation. Finish is sweet caramel malt with some fruitiness ending with a good hoppy bitterness. Overall a seemed a bit on the hoppy side but seems to be well balanced, a good drinkable brew.","10: A: poured a caramel brown with a thin head that left a little bit of sticky lacing on the glass. S: at first I get caramel aromas with a underlying floral hop notes which had a good malt presence. There was also some citrus and bready notes as well. T: some nice piney hops pop out on the taste with caramel and citrus grapefruit accents that help out on the bitterness. It seems to have a decent malt backbone that helps out the balance. M: medium body with a low amount of carbonation that still works out but had a slight sweet and bitter hop finish. D: pretty good IPA that drank well and had a good amount of sweetness but lacked on the hop punch. It was still a tasty brew.","61: From the can at SAVOR 2011. Pours a clear golden color with an average white head and a slight amount of white lacing on the way down. The nose brings quite a bit of citrus hop character, mostly tending toward grapefruit. Quite nice. The flavor has just a touch of malt in the background and is instead focused on a fairly-heavy hop presence. Orange and grapefruit come through and perhaps a bit of a floral character. Medium body with good bitterness. Nice and dry. Solid brew.","67: Pours a reddish orange with a thick off-white head. Lots of sticky lacing, head reduces down to nice crust. Smells of pine, grapefruit, and resinous hops. Nice hoppy flavor with citrus and pine notes. I tinge of malt as well. Medium bodied mouth feel and overall a very drinkable beer.","72: Like someone else has written this almost looked like a barleywine. A nice copper, slightly darker than I'd expect, a little thin head that leaves some lacing. Initially after the pour I took in whiffs of pine, and citrus, but after letting it settle I got more biscuit and sweet malts. Tastes like it smelled, initial hop blast that singes the tongue, then it subsides to give a biscuit\u002fmalt based finish. Overall, I'd say it tasted like a hoppy barleywine. Mouthfeel is medium to light, a bit of carbonation, but overall good. at 7% more or less, it's a decent offering","125: Thanks to Djeucalyptus for these! Poured from the can to a tulip. Fairly clear pale orange with a sticky, long lasting head. Lots of lacing. Fairly pungent resiny, piney aromas. Taste is very piney right away. Good hop bite and very crisp and clean feel. Just a great, easy drinking ipa- right up there with other great ones as far as drinkablity. Great beer!","147: Pours a really nice sunburnt orange. Subtle head is off white and minimal. Aroma - Lots of citrus, and tangy aromas, a little bit of dankness. I get clementine and tangerine, apricot, and a little peach. Flavor - solid bitterness with a crisp hop flavor. I get a good earthy flavor with a nice caramel note in the backround. Good malt backbone with biscuit and cracker dry notes. Overall- good everyday drinker IPA. Lots of hop goodness with a solid malt flavor to back it up.","158: Pours a nice clear golden pale with foamy white head. Smells nice with very apparent herbal hop aroma. Taste is smooth with a nice crackery malt flavor and a big bitter hop finish. A tad overly bitter for your typical pale ale, maybe needs a bit more malt but I still like it. Plus it comes in a can which is a GREAT thing. Go cans.","259: The first one poured with an incredibly large off white head with great retention. I was very careful the second time. Color was a hazy copper Smelled of bubble gum and citrus. Tastes like it smells, with a hint of lime. The grapefruit biterness kicks in at the end. Well carbonated, smooth, nicely balanced between malt and hops. A fine example of an American IPA. Highly recommended.","296: Appears a dark orange color with a large amount of white foam. It smells slightly of caramel, citrus and grassy hops. The smell is very well balanced you can smell both malts and hops. It tastes initially of semisweet malts the malty taste quickly goes away. A profound and flavorful hop bitterness soon follows. There is a nice citrus flavor and also a nice fruity sweetness. Overall a very solid IPA. The carbonation is moderate low. This is quite drinkable; I could drink a few of these in a row easy. An excellent IPA that is hoppy yet is balanced perfectly with semisweet malt.","323: Cloudy, brownish amber. Medium, foamy, off-white head. Some carbonation and a touch of lacing. Earthy, floral hop aroma, some bready malts. Flavor has more earthy hops, lots of bready, grainy malt. Heavy-ish body but not sweet. A nutty aftertaste. Odd for a west coast IPA; not hoppy at all but not much malt flavor or complexity going on either.","327: Served from can into a Delerium Tremens tulip. Pours a hazy red-orange with a one finger off-white head that slowly subsides to minimal. Maintains decent lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt, hops, and pine. The flavor was of malt and a load of hops. It was medium on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a very nice IPA from a can no-less. Definitely worth seeking out if you are an IPA fan as it is quite drinkable and enjoyable. I will be having another in the near future.","339: appearance - highly carbonated, boastful head (2-3 in), transparent golden amber smell - resinous hops (simcoe?) taste - highly resinous, pine, pronounced hop flavor, some sweet malts to balance it out (very subtle though) mouthfeel - high carbonation, medium body, slightly dry finish drinkability - nice big resinous hop profile, true oregon\u002fwest coast ipa, bordering on a session beer if you can handle the hops!","348: copper or amber in color. pretty clear with an off-white hop head forming on top. smells of pine up front and a hit of citrus zest toward the back. taste is refreshingly hopped. malty sweetness amongst the pine, resins, and citrus. mouthfeel is crispy with a slight bite. definetly drinkable.","388: Poured from a can into my snifter. A - A clear golden orange, slightly burnt red color body with a medium frothy light white head. S - Very nice and big citrus hop smell that is smooth and sweet. Very pleasant. T & M & D - Great fruit sweetness up front that is refreshing and almost minty cool. Then some bigger malty sweetness on mid palate and the slight fruit acidity cleans the end and brings in some slight airy floral notes. The mouth is light and very drinkable, I go back to refreshing. O - Awesome IPA and I love the can. They really pull of the style well. One of my favorites that I come back to often. -Cheers","440: Poured from the can into a tulip. Nice pour, perfect carbonation, nice medium head, solid lacing. Aroma is a perfect IPA balance of malt and citrusy piney hops. Taste matches aroma perfectly, this is a very balanced IPA. One weakness for me is the mouthfeel is the slightest bit thin. For all the flavor and aroma I would like it a bit \"chewier\". Very solid IPA.","446: A-Gold-light bronze. Big eggshell head. Brilliantly clear. S-Piney, citrusy hops. Crackers. Slight soapiness after a while. T-citrus rinds, some pine. Firm bitterness. Bitterness hides much of the malt but some crackery malt comes through. M-medium light bodied. Medium carbonation. No alcohol burn. really nice. D-Really nice beer. A bit on the bitter side to drink all night but a really tasty beer.","486: Apperance: Orange-y, light amber. Lacing left on the glass. Smell: Nice citrus hop aroma thats pretty minimal of a NW IPA, a nice chance. Taste: Malt flavor is rapidly replaced with a pretty bitter lasting hop finish. T Mouthfeel: darn easy drink.... Drinkability: Tasty beer, Id drink this again.","488: The beer pours a hazy dark golden\u002famber color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pale and Carapils scent along with a huge citrus hop aroma. There is a light breadiness as well. The taste is very good. It's light with a damn bitter hop taste. It's loaded with citrus goodness. The malt bill provides some balance, but this is a hop heavy beer. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great session IPA. It refreshingly hoppy and easily drinkable.","491: Super clear orange body with a frothy sticky head that lasts the whole beer, very impressive appearance. Smells sweet, pine, citrus, biscuity, earthy. Taste is very malty with very little bitterness which i was not expecting as this is an IPA and should have more hop profile the taste. A little too malty for my liking.","545: Pours a clear orange with a big tan head. Smells of citrus. Taste is very citrusy up front, with a nice caramel malt middle, and an herbal, smoky hop finish. Nice bitterness that clings to your tongue. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, nice low carbonation. Drinkability is great, several of these in a row wouldnt be difficult. A super choice for an IPA which conveniently comes in a can.","558: Thanks to Kegatron for hooking me up with a can. Pours a clear amber color with 3 fingers of tall foamy off-white head. Great retention leaves lots of lacing stick. Smells of caramel, pine, grapefruit, and spicy hops. Tastes of toasted grains, caramel, citrus fruits, and bitter spicy and earthy hops in the finish. Medium in body with good carbonation. Crisp and balanced with a nice woodsy bitter finish. Easy to drink and enjoyable. A solid sessionable IPA that has me looking forward to trying more stuff from Caldera.","616: Pours dark nice amberish color head. Smell is hoppy piney goodness Taste is hoppy (of course) I detected a tiny hint of citrus with followed by a nice grassy piney after taste. went down smooth and a wee bit creamy great beer to start the night out with. all and all typical Hopped out beer, but price VS quality one of the best out there.","618: Pours a nice clear and bright amber color with a decent head, and a bit of lacing. Aromas are pine like, earthy, pungent and resiny. Smells a bit funky, but not bad. Taste is crisp, biting, with some sharp brewed tea flavors up front. Hint of hard candy sweetness, and light creamy malt flavors. Finish is bitter, earthy, grassy, and dry. Mouthfeel is very good. Very full, smooth, and nicely carbonated. Overall, an interesting and tasty beer. A but different than most IPAs brewed on the West Coast, unique, and rough around the edges, but I like it.","620: Pours golden with 1 finger of eggshell white head. good head retention & lacing S: Slight lemony & grassy hop notes, plus a bit of breadyness T: Lemony & grapefruitty hops; plus a bit of honey malt up front. Some grainyness & grapefruit hops as this warms. Finishes crisp with a load of grapefruit MF: Light\u002f medium bodied with lively carbonation that really show cases the hops, for better or worse. Skews too hoppy, makes me think IPA more than APA Drinks pretty easy despite the OTT hoppyness.. still a solid APA","633: A: Pours a clear golden color, not too much head or lacing down the glass S: Grassy\u002fpiney type hop scent, nothing too fragrant though T: Mild sweetness followed by a nice crisp grassy\u002fherbal hop flavor M: Light to medium bodied, carbonation is pretty good O: This is a nice summer BBQ beer, I think i may like their amber better but this one is a decent pale.","649: A-Full bronze. big light tan head. brilliantly clear. S-Some toasty malt. Light citrus hop aroma. Not a lot going on. T-Carmelly malty. Firm bitterness but more balanced to the malt than their Pale ale. Not much in the way of hop flavor. Lots of bitterness but not much flavor. M-medium bodied. medium carbonation. No alcohol burn. D-An average tasting IPA. Needs more hop flavor and aroma. Bitterness and malt are spot on. Still not a bad beer.","650: pours a copper slight haze color with a 1 finger head..smell is citrus and pine with hops and malt..taste is the same its a pine hit first with some floral hops and sweet malts.a bitter finish in the back of the mouth..this ipa is pretty tasty if you like a pney crisp ipa with some sweet malts..i could drink a couple of these no problem..but would not be my choice of ipas when looking for one","660: Can from Beerzack. Thanks! Pours Semi-clear reddish amber witha big lasting chunky whitish head that leaves lots of lacing. Smell is sweet fruity, fresh and hoppy. Very nice. Taste is smooth with fruity caramel and fresh citrusy, and sweet orange flavored hops and bitter citrus rind. Nice and strongly bittered which lasts in the finish but with a light lingering sweetness too. Very good IPA.","661: Nice amber color with a great head and lacing, plus it's in a can! Love it when beers are in cans. It smells piney and earthy and gains in the taste. Earthy Munich malts balance with a lot of citrusy and herbal northwestern hops, with some metallic and peppery notes sneaking in to make a solid but not outstanding IPA. Slight stickiness to the mouthfeel, but very drinkable overall.","698: Appearance: Orange-amber with a slight haze to it. The eggshell colored head retains remarkably well, leaving a ton of sticky lace behind. Smell: Floral with a bit of resiny pine and grapefruit. Great hop aroma with no noticeable malt presence. Taste & mouthfeel: Malty but very dry. Floral and resiny hop flavors follow, leading way to a bitter finish with a hint of grapefruit. The medium-light body and restrained ABV make this one seriously drinkable IPA.","713: nice burnt orange with a white head that holds fairly well and leaves very pretty lace. nose and taste consist of piney, citrusy and maybe peachyish hops with a caramelly backbone. decent mouthfeel, a little thicker would be good for me, but there is no doubt this is a first class ipa. tons of competition keep the ratings down, but i could knock these back all night and be in sweet hophead bliss the whole time.","722: Nice dark orange colured ale, small lightv tan head. I dont like the aroma, it certainlly has hops aplenty, but has a sour ,sweaty work sock aroma that puts me off in the background. The flavor is better, very strong oniony hopping, pink grapefruit and spruce tips. Thin and maybe even a tad under carbonated. I dint really dig this one. I liked their Pale Ale way better.","741: I got this beer from Tilley4. Thanks Jason! 12oz can served in a standard pint glass. L - slightly hazed copper color with a bone white head that left trails of lacing. S - citrus rind and a slab of butter rolled in dirt. T - bitter citrus rind upfront with some buttery notes before getting dry and tart on the finish. F - medium bodied with a biting feel and smooth carbonation. D - goes down quick and easy.","751: A: a coppery, somewhat bronze type color with a nice thin layer of lace left atop. S: Malty and some dark fruit notes... plumb\u002ffig..but a sweet T: the malty sweentness blended with the dark fruits do make for an interesting tasting beer. M: medium bodied dark ale, relatively easy to drink... O: pretty good beer.","769: Pours out a clear, amber\u002forange with a 2-finger, thick, white head that leaves moderate, splotchy lacing. The smell is both fruity and malty, malt dominates. Taste is fruity, citrus hops up front then overtaken by a strong malt flavor and finishes with bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium, well-carbonated at first but low later. Drinkability is fine. I like it and many of those who like IPAs will also.","779: Appearance: Pours a clear, orangey-copper body with a small, bubbly white head. Smell: Aroma of caramel malts with an herbal, citrus hop presence. Taste: Mild caramel malt flavor and sweetness. Zesty citrus hops and the taste of fresh herbs. A pinch more of those caramel malts reemerge for the overall bitter finish. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Slight stickiness to the mouthfeel. Drinkability: Whaddya know, it's a fairly good IPA.","780: Copper and light red pour, standard head to it. Dry hopping nose was there, but not huge, not super awesome or anything, just a bit of subtle vegetal hop quality to it with the peat malt thing. Citrus quality comes out on the tongue. Bitterness sustains itself throughout the entire beer. Pretty much an ordinary red spruced up with some green hops, and yes, it works. Makes the ordinary a little less ordinary. Doesn't skimp on the maltiness either. Dry finish for a red. Solid stuff, would drink again, and definitely recommend to someone who likes red ales. I am not fond of them, but enjoyed this.","783: Poured from the can into a glass tumbler. Nice aroma and pale yellow appearance. Nice fluffy head and fair amount of lacing. Taste was a big surprise, I thought any beer from a can would be a let-down. The initial malt sweetness was nicely balanced by the hop bitterness. Not like an IPA for sure but impressive anyway. Mouthfeel was O.K. and drinkability was good. Made with whole flower Cascade hops.","832: Hazy apricot color with a solid frothy eggshell colored head with great retention and lacing. Visible carb at the edges. Nice floral and grapefruit hop notes on the nose. Good clean flavors. Nice mild hop notes up front with the same characteristics as the nose balanced well with the middle-backended caramel maltiness. Hops create a slightly bitter aftertaste. Mouth is crisp with a bit of a zip and high carb. Overall it's a good pale ale. A perfect beer to have in a can like it is, being a perfect beer to have while camping, golfing, fishing etc.","837: A - Poured out a slightly hazy, auburn\u002famber color with a thick, foamy, tan, two-finger head. It left some nice lace. S - It smelled of tons of pine. Sweet notes of grapefruit and orange peel. T - It was very peppery and spicy with a smooth burnt toast maltiness. Some subtle citrus flavors, too. M - It was crisp and sharp. A light to medium-bodied beer. D - This is a pretty good IPA. Here in the Midwest the price tag was a bit high, though.","883: Snagged a can of this after seeing that it's got such a positive amount of reviews. The beer poured out as a clear yellowish gold color, it has a pretty good looking soapy head on it. The lacing is a little sticky but not too much. The smell of the beer has a really nice malty and hoppy aroma. The hops smell bright and fruity. The taste of the beer was pretty good. The hops were definitely in there ready to hit ya in the mouth. The malt cleaned up the mess in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was light and refreshing. Overall it was a pretty good IPA.","891: A - pours an amber color with a two finder head that is retained for a good 5-10 minutes. The beer is almost as clear as a lager...not cloudy at all. S - very strong citrus smells. T - similar to the smells, the first predominant taste is citrusy. After that, you get a hint of caramel. Then the hops come through and leave a nice bitterness finish. D - I love this IPA. It's one of my favorites! It's exactly how a west coast IPA should taste. The only issue could be a slight lack in carbonation.... But I find that true of most craft can beer I try.","901: Pours a nice golden peach color with a frothy long lasting ivory head. Smells of earthy grassy hops and a little citrus. Great tasting with plenty of bitterness and some grapefruit. Just enough of a malt backbone to let those grassy hops shine. A medium-bodied and flavorful IPA available in a can that reminded me of a nicer version of 60 min. If the price point were lower, I'd drink this a ton.","924: A: Dark amber in color, the head was amazing. Slighly off white head, with enough retention to balance the can on it if I wanted to. S: Lots of citrus and piney hops. T: Wasn't sure what to expect from my first \"real\" can of beer. It was very well balanced. You had a good citrus and piney resin working together on this one. M\u002fD: It had good carbonation, the end was mildly bitter and oily. I thought this was a great first for me.","932: A - hazey orange in color with a rocky white head which quickly dissipates to a thin film. S - the nose is rich with hops. piney and fruity. sweet caramel malt notes and some cherry esters. T - clean, lightly sweet malt upfront followed by some piney bitterness and a long cherry\u002fsweetish finish. M - smooth, creamy, a touch watery and a full zippy carbonation. O - nice IPA with lots of piney notes but could've had a bit more bitterness on the tongue.","984: Pours a very nice golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice creamy one-finger plus off-white head, lots of nice small islands and sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, big hop note, citrus\u002fpines, and caramel. The taste is very nice, malty, hoppy, with some nice citrus\u002fpine tones, with some caramel thrown in. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very solid IPA (in a can too), definitely recommended.","989: a: This was a very pale, clear golden color. It was served to me with craggy, sticky head that stuck around for awhile. s: Big piney hop nose with a little lemon. t: This tasted very fresh. Sweet flavors of toffee and then a big piny hop blast at the end. m: Fabulous carbonation, long lasting. Perfect. d: One of the best IPAs I've tried. Great stuff.","1000: Reviewed on 1\u002f3\u002f2010. Can. Pours a clear deep orange with a thick off-white head. Aroma of piney, grassy hops, some citrus and tropical fruits. Flavor of caramel malt and light citrus upfront with a bitter hops finish. Decent IPA, rather on the bitter side.","1002: Pours a clear burned orange with a creamy head that dies somewhat quickly and little to no lacing. Smells like a hop bomb with strong citrus, rind and a tiny bit of floral. Blows away your taste buds with hops and a bite of citrus. The balance isnt as great as it could be but this sure is tasty, especially if you are a hop head. Finishes wonderfully dry and bitter but doesnt linger too long on the tongue. Carbonation is perfect. A very drinkable and delicious IPA....and from a can no less.","1004: A - Poured a copper color with a big off white head that leaves a ton of lacing behind S - Is a nose full of hops that are both citrus and piney with a touch of caramel malt kicking around T - Follows the nose hops upfront more pine than citrus with the caramel malt trying to come through to add some balance M - This beer has a medium body with higher carbonation to it D - I'm enjoying this IPA quite a bit I don't know if it coming from a can is making me like it more but this beer tastes good and is worth a try if you see it around","1009: Pours a clear gold color, with a big impressive white head. Nice hoppy cascade nose. Floral, and pine like. Beer has a pretty light quality. But is still tasty. Light crisp hop flavor, a bit of malty sweetness and creaminess, and a slightly piney and resiny hop finish. Nice simple APA. Mouthfeel is pretty good. As mentioned, it's a bit light, but still feels nice in the mouth. Drinkability is very good. Light and easy drinking, yet still a tasty APA. Session worthy. I love canned craft beer!","1019: This beer poured out as a nice golden color, almost copper. The head was fluffy and white, left behind a strong lacing too. The smell of the beer was floral and citrusy. The taste of the beer has a sweet bitterness, plenty of citrusy grapefruit flavors and a touch of malt in the back end. The mouthfeel has a good bite to it, with a dry aftertaste. Overall it's a good IPA, I am glad I tried it for sure.","1031: Tapped this open and a fruity piney smell, Cloudy golden orange color when poured in a pint glass. Nice foaming thick head. Big and hoppy, yet smooth as butter. Minimal hop after taste (I like this, so was a liittle disappointed with the lack there of there) However, a delicious beer. Would drink it anytime!! I bet on draft it is a delight!","1072: Can from K&L Redwood City. A - Pours a bright medium amber color with a two-finger, lasting off-white head and good lacing. S - Aroma is piney and citrusy hops, a touch of sweet malt, and tropical fruits. T - Flavor is a little pale and caramel malt, but mostly showcases a complex hop profile, with pine, pineapple, orange, and grapefruit. Pretty harshly bitter, although I like that of course. M - Crisp palate with medium body and carbonation. D - Solid. Overall this is the best canned IPA I've had after Surly Furious.","1073: Thanks to 5000 for sending this can my way. The beer pours a dark amber color with a white head. Darker than expected. The aroma is very nice. I get a lot of grapefruit and pine notes. The flavor is similar. The predominant flavor is some resiny pine from the hops but I also get some grapefruit. The toffee and caramel malt backbone balance out the beer nicely and keep the bitterness level fairly low for a west coast IPA. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very nice.","1126: Poured from a can into a pint glass A - Amber in color with a thick, off-white head. S - Not as much hop aroma as I had hoped. There is some citrusy hop aroma and a bit of stickiness to it. T - better hop character in the taste. Good malt backbone to balance the hops. The finish is a bit chalky and biscuity. M - The biscuitiness interferes with the mouthfeel to me. A bit too thick on the tongue for an IPA. D - Nothing unpleasant about the way this one goes down. Alcohol is well masked and the carbonation level is right where it needs to be.","1136: A- Pours a nice amber color with a whit head. S- Hops with a citrus tone hint of malt. T- Hops and citrus tones with a hint of a malt finish. M- Semi dry with hop flavors through out sip and a malt finish. D- Pretty good beer from Oregon. I can drink this again with no worries. Cheers...","1150: A: Pours a cloudy orange with a crisp white two finger head layer. S: Slightly citrusy with a bit of hops here, too. T: Malty and hoppy, but neither overpowers. Very well balanced. M: Calm and balanced flavors. D: This would be a great beer for a hot summer day. Nothing wild, but simply a good beer.","1152: A= basic blonde, mild white head, decent lacing. S= honey and floral hops notes. More evident as the beer warmed for a few minutes. T= immediately astringent and dry, somewhat watery, some florals, pine, bitters. M= astringent, some bitterness, florals. D= fine if you like it, depends on the price versus better APA offerings.","1162: Poured into a tulip glass. A light golden orange color. Very clear with almost 2 fingers of creamy rich pillowy head. This thing smells like candied hops. Lots of orange citrus covered in caramel. Tastes alot like the aroma only a bit on the lighter side. The citrus is there, the caramel is there and there is also a small amount of floral notes as well. Light to medium bodied with a crisp bitter finish. Overall this is an excellent canned IPA that i could drink all day long. Notes: Review taken from notes written on 5-25-10","1168: A: Poured a pale amber color, clear with good carbonation leaving a nice white head S: Light caramel, hops, bitterness, some citrus and floral notes T: Floral and citrus with impressive hops, def a American West Coast IPA here. M: Lighter bodied with hop bitterness leaving a crisp, bitterness D: Good. I actually thought this could have been a modest single IPA as well","1179: Pours a clear very light yellow with strong carbonation but a weak head. The aroma is sweet, non-descript malt with just a touch of grassy hops and some graininess. The flavor is quite similar with pale malt sweetness, some grassy herbal hops, clean yeast, grainy notes and a surprising amount of bitterness. I have to say that the flavor is pretty disappointing, even for this style, though the dryness does give it some merit. Mouthfeel is not just light, but watery. It has a nice dry finish and is very quaffable, and holds up alright when compared to other beers in this category, but I think there are better options.","1183: A: Deep apricot hue with a huge, beautiful, sudsy cream-colored head; lacing is great S: Lots of wonderful citrus from the hops: peach, mango, pineapple, lemon, grapefruit, and tea leaves with a slightly grassy and grainy malt undertone T: Hops are a touch more muted than aromas indicated but still plenty of citrus, tea leaves, pine, and weed F: Quite creamy upfront and finishing pretty well--though a touch thin O: A nice hop-forward IPA in a can, which you can never get enough of; something I'd like to try even fresher and something I will definitely come back to","1215: Poured from a 12 oz can into a pint glass. Pours a hazy copper color, with a very small head. Not much lacing. The aroma is very hop forward, notes of citrus. Everything good about the nose gets ramped up a notch in the taste. Huge grapefruit and orange flavors, good malt backbone and a really nice hop finish. Medium bodied, carbonation is good. An incredibly drinkable IPA, will definately seek out again!","1240: A: Pours to a frothey tan head with a deep and beautiful copper body. Excellent lacing. S: Slight, hoppy, piney aroma. T: Citrusy with piney hops. Crisp and not real bitter but it does have a slight bite with lasting flavor. The hops definitely comes through. A nice IPA that doesn't knock you over. Typically what an IPA is suppose to be. M: Lightly carbonated, smooth and thin. Not watery or oily. D: Refreshing and while not a session beer, you can easily enjoy a couple of these without any problems. One of the better canned micro-brews that I have tried.","1257: Copper colored beer with a nice sticky off-white head with some orange hues. Classic Western IPA aroma of loads of citric hops. Also some mildly herbal aromas but this beer is all about the C-hops. Well balanced yet still hoppy. Grapefruit, pinecones and fresh mint in the flavor. Medium to full bodied and wayyy too drinkable. I looked down and my glass was empty. A great IPA in a can, what's not to love. Oh yeah, we can't get it in NC that's what's not to love.","1260: A - Pours a medium amber color with a 1-2 finger head with some lacing. S - You get hit with the regular Pine and Citrus but also some sweet malt on the back end T - Flavor was thinner than some IPA's but still nice with the Pine and Citrus, almost a little too much malt on the back end for me and not as smooth as I would have hoped. M - Crisp IPA light\u002fmedium body with medium carbonation. D - Pretty Good. The best canned IPA I have had, although it was my first canned IPA. Next time I think I would rather have two Pliny's to a six pack of this.","1265: A: Yellow and clear. Nice 1 finger white head. S: Not much here. Slight Cascade hops and malt. I was a bit disappointed at first because the smell was unimpressive. T: A nice mix of the C hops. This gives a mouth full of bitter grapefruit and citrus. M: Very bitter, just like it should be. It is also quite crisp, which makes for a refreshing IPA. No alcohol burn at all. D: This is an excellent easy drinking IPA. I wish the aroma was a little more hoppy, but overall I enjoyed the brew. I am happy to find this on the shelves at my local craft beer store.","1299: Amber with hints of orange with big tan foamy head with good retention and uneven lacing. Big citrus hop aroma. Big bitter grapefruit up frony with good caramel mellowing backbone. Smooth, silky feel with a low carb feel despite the big foamy head. A good overhopped IPA that's pleasant yet slightly one dimensional. Not worth $13.50\u002f6 pack unless you really need a good IPA in a can.","1303: Appearance: Pours a hazy, yellow-orange body with a thin, wispy white head. Smell: Aroma of herbal, citrus hops accompanied by a honey-laden maltiness. Taste: Mild pale malts with a bit of toastiness and a soft honey-like sweetness. Citrus and bitter herbs. Medium bitterness. Finishes dry. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Drinkability: A fair pale ale, but I gotta say I enjoyed the Caldera IPA far, far more.","1304: Poured amber from the can. Nice one inch head with plenty of lacing. Aroma is earthy citrus hops and a bit of sweet malt. Flavor is usual hops citrus and pine in this case. Nice balance of hops and malts with hops dominating. Good mouthfeel not too watery. Amazingly good canned beer! Highly recommended if you enjoy IPA's. Try the APA also.","1325: Clear light copper. Thick offwhite head. Decent retention. Nice tight laces. Pine, floral, citrus, and spicy hop aromas. Rich toasty, mild sweet caramel and a touch of vanilla. Crisp grapefruit, floral, pine, spicy resins. Toasty sweet caramel rolls in. Piney\u002fpeppery bitterness. Smooth, semi-rich medium body. good medium carbonation. Some drying and stickiness. Great canned IPA. Very drinkable and very tasty. Tailgating and camping and grilling favorite.","1327: Pours a clean orange-ish to copper color with a light tan head. In the aroma, faint pine like hops. In the taste, mellow pine hops and a nice malt balance. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry to clean hop aftertaste. More a pale than IPA, but decent nonetheless.","1331: 12oz can poured into a pint Pours a hazy golden color with a fluffy white head. Some nice staying power and spider web lacing. The aroma is musty and earthy with layers of pine and orange. On the palate, this guy is a little more pine and citrus forward while the earthy, musty hops come through in the middle. The finish is earthy bitter with a touch of pine resin. Light medium body with good carbonation. This is a nice pale ale that deserves a spot in any rotation. Borderline sessionable.","1334: Wierd tasting IPA, thrown in a trade. Starts OK, and then residual odd hop flavours. Medium yellow body, a quarter inch of white foam. A little hop aromas. Not skunky, but just another AMerican IPA to me, with moe astringency than balance. A bit aggressive carbonation.","1411: A- Nice bright red color with a pretty foamy head. Lace is allready showing off and trying to get me to take a sip before finishing the sentance. S- Heavy citrus blend with a sweet finish. Smells like a much hoppier beer than an IPA. T- Much maltier than the nose lets on, sweeter too. I taste a lot of grain and oils. Slightly buttery. M- Truely a medium bodied sample. Not watery but definatley not full either. D- Good pick up from the store as something new. Not something I would recommend to a friend as a must try, but a maybe try for those looking to try new IPAs. Thanks Caldera...another decent brew from Oregon.","1412: A: A light orange gold, with modest tightly knit bit of head that stays. S: Nice piney, grapefruit and citrus, hint of biscuity malts T: First flavors are a strong, piney, grapefruit bite, with a tad of crystalish malts barely balancing it out, then a bitter finish of resinous west coast hops. M: Medium bodied, average carbonation, slightly sticky, cloying finish. maybe from the hops. D: Decent drinkability, though I've had much more drinkable IPA's. Still a very delicious west coast IPA well worth the try. Just probably wouldn't make this session beer.","1449: A - Pours a hazy burnt orange. A billowy 3 finger head. Average lacing. S - Big citrus aroma, caramel, hints of alcohol, dried herbs. T - Citrus hops with some strawberry fruitiness. Some floral spice in the back fades into toasted caramel malt. The malt has a nice sweetness that keeps the hops from taking over everything. The malt seems shy at first but opens up as you go. My first IPA out of a can. Very easy drinking. Good stuff!","1479: A - pours a deep rust orange with 1\u002f4 inch of white foam S - citrus and hints of piney hops T - slightly citrus hops with a major piney hop kick at the end, not overpoweringly bitter, just a really tasty treat M\u002fD - medium bodied and decent carbonation, definitely a nice IPA that I could have several of","1493: 12oz can poured into a pint glass Pours a bright yellow with nice head, very little lacing. Smells slightly hoppy, mostly wet greens. Taste is a tiny little bit of honey and a fair amount of hops, some floral. Nice bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light and effervescent. Pretty drinkable. Not as good as their IPA, I don't think.","1502: A: Nice amber color with quite an impressive head. About what you'd expect from a good IPA :) S: Very citrusy, lots of grapefruit, lemons, etc.. T: Surprisingly non-bitter. Tastes closer to an APA than an IPA. Nice clean grapefruit with a bit of bitterness on the back end (but not too much). M: Surprisingly light. Carbonation suits it perfect to keep it crisp. O: Overall pretty impressive for a beer I've never heard of. Not too hoppy, not too malty, not too bitter, just does everything pretty well (but not amazingly, admittedly).","1514: A: Pale amber in color, beutifully clear, with a nice white head. S: Sweet caramel, a slight tropical fruit flavor with a hint of pine wood. T: Sweet fruit flavor at first, followed by a nice tropical hops flavor. A bit of a malt in the back, but the hop flavor dominate. Not too bitter, just pleasantly hoppy. M: Medium bodied, slightly chewy, perhaps a little over carb'd D: Very good overall, but I would like to see a little more balance from the malty side. I think the hop profile is dead on.","1532: Pours crystal clear golden amber, yellowish thick head, chunky head that falls leaving ample lacing. Smells like cidery malt, hops seemed to be subdued, slight fruitiness. Taste is bitter up front, astringent bitterness twang, slight malt but the body is too light to carry the bitterness. Borderline metallic taste, slightest fruitiness. Not the most fantastic but something I can finish, I'd probably buy this again, as the brew isn't too heavy like some IPAs.","1538: A- Good copper amber with a head that lingers. S - Pine, tropical fruit, and caramely malt T - A balanced IPA. The hops give it a good fruity and bitter punch, but the caramel malts really give the most character and are present and linger throughout the whole experience. M - Decent carbonation, not too carbonated, and smooth mouthfeel. O - A highly sessionable and pleasant IPA!","1546: Deep dark orange in color with a one-finger tan head which lingers a second then drops away leaving a few small specks of lace. Sweet malts and oily hops rise pleasantly to the nose. Some subtle pine is mixed in. Tastes of bright fresh citrusy hops and the malt backbone does it's job evening things out well. Not as big on the hops as many other IPA's, but being that it comes in the can this one begs to be taken to the lake or to the beach as it has just enough taste to keep things interesting, and the fact that it's in a can is fookin' cool.","1548: Poured from the can into a Sam Adams \"Perfect\" pint glass. (I don't know why, but beer seems to taste better out of this glass vs a regular pint glass. Call me crazy) A - Nice dark burnt orange color, off-white head, good lacing. S - Pine, grapefruit, mango, nice!!! T - Bitter and piney upfront, with a nice grapefuit and earthy end. Well balanced. Tasty. M - Medium with medium amount of carbonation. D - High. Very tasting and refreshing. Not the hoppiest IPA out there, but well-balanced and tasty. Extremely easy to drink. Great beer. I am really starting to like these Caldera guys!","1593: The beer pours a nice yellow-orange, with a thick white head. Looks delish. Maybe its my nose, but I don't detect too much - citrusy hops with a pine undergirding. But the taste is exceptional. Wonderfully bright hops and a satisfying malt backbone. But like most west coast ipas, this is not balanced...thankfully. A hops explosion of grapefruit, spice, and pine. Awesome. This is the best IPA i've had in a can...and one of the better ones around PERIOD. Check this one out.","1623: A: Beer poured a light amber color with a orange hue and large 1\" off white head that lasted for sometime. Good lacing on the sides of the glass throughout consumption. S: Citrus, orange pith, pine, and some light caramel notes. T: As with the smell I get grapefruit, orange pith, lots of pine and some light caramel malt balance. This one is pretty hop dominate. M: Medium-light bodied, good carbonation with a drying finish. D: This beer is definately six pack worth and will be one of my camping beers from here on out.","1625: Love the IPA from these guys so I had to give this one a go... Pours a light golden yellow... Sorta hazy... Pretty decent head... Balanced aromas of malt and hops with the malts being a little more dominant... Sweet buttery malts with a slight hop finish at the end... The hops seem a bit muted here... Could have been a bit more balanced... A decent brew I guess... Not one that I will reach for again especially with the IPA available..","1627: HOPS! If you like a hoppy beer, this is for you. Pours a golden brown with a nice foamy head. Complex flavors keep you interested with citrus and fruity notes. Just enough maltiness to keep the hops from being completely overwhelming. Aroma is strong with fruity citrus notes as well.","1649: A: Poured a hazy amber color with a nice white cap S: Faded piney hops, caramel T: Caramel and faded hops battle for dominance while the metallic and old Earthy notes fight for second place. Bad. M: Medium to full body and not one I would recommend hiolding on your palate O: Poor IPA, drainpoured after two sips","1658: First micro brew for me in a can. Cool logo but with no freshness date. It pours a amber color with a nice sea foam head. The smell is strong of hops. The taste hits you with a dry hop appeal with a huge hop profile. It leaves a stinging pleasant aftertaste as it journeys down the throat. I really like the uniqueness of the this American IPA profile.","1666: 22oz bottle A- Pours a hazy amber color with an off-white head with decent retention and lacing. S- The aroma is sweet malt and some citrus notes from the centennial hops as well. The aroma is good, but a little more subdued than I was expecting. T- The taste like the aroma is smooth and malty up front with the hops coming in and lingering well into the finish. M- The mouthfeel is light bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. D- Overall, I enjoyed Hopportunity Knocks but I isn't a beer I would likely seek out again. Worth a try.","1697: appearance - light amber color, just a little darker than I expected from the nose, big frothy head. Smell - very nice hop, pine, some fruit taste - nice hoppy grapefruite taste, dry finish mouthfeel - very even, not too thin, not too chewy for a single ipa overall - solid, I doubt I will pay $12.99 again for this brew and it probably factored into my rating","1721: a- can poured into a pint, two finger off white head with nice retention, hazy tawny amber coloring. s- earthy hops, some pine, grapefruit pith, bitterness, slight malt. t- earthy, bitter grapefruit rind dominates, some pine, some lemon, tasty lingering bitterness as well. m- medium body, slick. d- good, i'd drink this again, but probably wouldn't seek out and buy. this is a solid canned craft ipa though.","1759: Standard lighter yellow pale ale here, good foamy head. Nice soft floral hop arrangement, if you like caldera, you'll be all good here. Plenty of taste in a pale, relative hefty amount of hops for style, light, ever so light toasting of the malt allows the hops to shine without making them exist in a ridiculous amount. Bitterness is sturdy, minty and metallic, but not a distraction or covering up the more delicate aspect of the beer, would say it leans to the grapefruit side of hop taste, cascade, chinook seem to be all over this one.","1764: Poured a deep copper hue with a one and a half finger foamy white head. There was good retention and lacing. The smell featured a full cereal grain, caramel and a citric hop. The taste was mainly hop driven with a grain full malt behind. Citus and pine dominated. Theouthfeel was typical of the style with a very dry finish. Overall a tasty hop driven west coast ale.","1769: Great golden color-very clear-a tad deeper in in color then some pales. Good aroma-mellow hopiness to it-sort of grassy. Great flavor-well balanced between a good level of bitterness and the malt. Really good hop flavor to it as well as the bitterness. Good body as well. Very, very drinkable beer. Almost a shame to drink it right from the can!!!! As much as I love macros I cant help but say whoo hoo great beer in a can lets go camping!!!","1776: Pours a clear, amber color. 1\u002f2 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of strong hops and slight earthy malt. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of strong hops, some sweet malt, and some earthy malt. Overall, a very tasty IPA and by far the best beer I've ever had from a can. This was practically mind blowing for me to really enjoy a canned beer. Definitely worth a try!","1789: Poured from a can into a a Chouffe Flute A-Very deep nice amber\u002fdark copper laces thick and sticky down the glass, very sexy looking in the glass. S-very floral bitter hop smell. Grapefruit notes very citrusy. T-Much like the nose great bitterness in the front middle and back. Has a nice sweet malt quality in the middle, almost like a sweeter orange flavor very subtle but adds alot. M-Medium body near perfect on the carbonation. D-Only reason this is not a 5 is the price everything else about this beer on this section is flawless.","1801: Purchased in Portland during my spring break Pacific Northwest trip, the only bottle offering I've had from Caldera. Poured is a orange hued color. This IPA tastes maltier than the ones I used to have. Drinking at near room temperature made this even maltier-tasting, which isn't necessarily bad, but to me it tastes more like an amber than an IPA. It's a good beer but not outstanding.","1811: A: pours clear, pale orange maybe some yellow. The head is about a finger and a half of off white head. The head did settle down to a thin layer and did leave a good amount of lacing. S: malt is sweet, slightly grainy. Hops are a little piny, and a little bit grassy. T: again with the sweet lightly grainy malt. Hops bring about, mostly pine, a little citrus, and even some grass to the palate. M: carbonation is tingly and nice. Otherwise it smooth on the palate. O: yet another impressive brew from a can, good balanced flavor.","1821: 12 ounce can. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a hazy amber color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention is pretty good, and there is a lot of lacing left behind on the glass. Aroma is herbal and citrusy hops, along with a bit of sweet malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, it's mostly hops with some sweet malt noticable too. There's also a nice lingering bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel\u002fbody is medium, it's slick with moderate carbonation. It's easy enough to drink. I think it's a good solid IPA. I'd buy this one again in the future.","1828: Eh. A little surprised at the rating here. Pours a copper, reddish orange. Definitely not the familiar yellowish, golden orange of most IPAs. Large off-white head. Smells faintly of pine, more strongly of ... well, citrus. Not quite grapefruit, just citrus-y. And there's maybe a whiff of malt. Well, maybe not. There's a strange toasted after-taste to the malt, and the hop flavoring is a touch muted. Really more like a pale ale than an ipa to me, though not quite that either. Some grapefruit, some random-y citrus notes, and a touch of sweet malt. Decent, but nothing to write home about.","1855: Good IPA and in a can!!! Pours a light amber\u002fgolden clear color with a medium sized frothy white head. Average retention and thick rings of lacing. Smell includes piney and citrus hops. Prominent and good. Tastes good as well. Piney and citrus hops and enough malt to be able to say balanced. The hops win out and the beer is still bitter but also smooth, crisp and easy to drink. Mouthfeel is crisp and starts out a bit thin. But like many IPAs, the hops coat the tongue and make the beer appear more rich. Drinkability is good. Good tasting, balanced and smooth.","1856: Sampled from a can with no freshness date. Big billowy off-white head with decent retention. Burnt orange in color. Medium bodied with an oily feel and aggressive carbonation. Solid caramel malty aroma with a hint of citrusy grapfruit hop flavor near the finish. Orange citrus flavores up front that transitions to bitter pine hop flavor that quickly follows thru the middle and to the finish. Noce caramel malt undertone throughout. Decent hop character and balance but lacked the hop intensity of a really goof IPA.","1859: Thanks to bman1113vr for sharing this bottle. The beer pours a clear brown color with a tan head. The aroma is heavy on the toffee and not too much else. The flavor is toffee, leather, tobacco, wood and dark fruit. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A decent beer but nothing too exciting.","1905: Clear dark amber with a good three finger white head. Plentiful lacings. Aroma is fruity citrus hops with a bit of leather. Taste is full deep leathery bitter hops with the correct amount of malts. The label describes \"centennial hops\" as the mainstay of all that bitterness. Mouthfeel is just right, and drinkability is very good for this style. Kudos to Caldera for daring to bottle a limited production beer. Their normal regimen is cans. Cool label. Give the fellows from the \"State of Jefferson\" a big thumbs up! Keep it coming Caldera!","1907: Poured into an imperial nonic a clear copper with a great one finger sticky white head that nver really leaves,a frothy mass is there during the whole duration of the glass.Big caramel malt in the nose with subdued citric hops,a little hop oomph and it would be great.Citric and herbal hops play against a big caramel\u002fbiscuit malt base with neither getting the upper heand really.There is a little lightly roasted nuttiness in the malt profile as well.A beer thats oh so close to being stellar,just bump up the hop profile and there you go,as is its pretty good.","1916: Thanks Woody! Poured a very orange\u002fcopper brew with 1 finger of head that faded quickly leaving decent lacing. Smell was light citrusy\u002fpine hop combo. Taste was bigger on the pine but accented with nicely with citrus Mouthfeel was medium to full nice and chewy for an IPA Drinkability is good something you could put a few back of and relax with nothing that made me go WOW I need to get this again though.","1940: Reddish amber with good clarity. Modest head that leaves light lacing. Pretty color, but fairly unusual for an IPA. Pleasant nose but more malty than hoppy - graham cracker maybe? Herbal hop character with moderate lingering bitterness. A bit metallic. Medium bodied. A bit juicy but metallic bitterness builds to dominate the impression.","1887: #BeforeTheFlood Watch #BeforeTheFlood right here, as @LeoDiCaprio travels the world to tackle climate change... https:\u002f\u002ft.co\u002fHCIZrPUhLF","2: RT @littoralsociety: The problem with global warming\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009dand the reason it continues to resist illustration, even as the streets flood and... h\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6","66: RT @NatGeoChannel: Watch #BeforeTheFlood right here, as @LeoDiCaprio travels the world to tackle climate change https:\u002f\u002ft.co\u002fLkDehj3tNn htt\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6","98: RT @NatGeoChannel: Watch #BeforeTheFlood right here, as @LeoDiCaprio travels the world to tackle climate change https:\u002f\u002ft.co\u002fLkDehj3tNn htt\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6","118: RT @NatGeoChannel: Watch #BeforeTheFlood right here, as @LeoDiCaprio travels the world to tackle climate change https:\u002f\u002ft.co\u002fLkDehj3tNn htt\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6","126: RT @NatGeoChannel: Watch #BeforeTheFlood right here, as @LeoDiCaprio travels the world to tackle climate change https:\u002f\u002ft.co\u002fLkDehj3tNn htt\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6","180: RT @NatGeoChannel: Watch #BeforeTheFlood right here, as @LeoDiCaprio travels the world to tackle climate change https:\u002f\u002ft.co\u002fLkDehj3tNn htt\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6","243: RT @NatGeoChannel: Watch #BeforeTheFlood right here, as @LeoDiCaprio travels the world to tackle climate change https:\u002f\u002ft.co\u002fLkDehj3tNn htt\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6","275: RT @NatGeoChannel: Watch #BeforeTheFlood right here, as @LeoDiCaprio travels the world to tackle climate change https:\u002f\u002ft.co\u002fLkDehj3tNn htt\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6","279: RT @NatGeoChannel: Watch #BeforeTheFlood right here, as @LeoDiCaprio travels the world to tackle climate change https:\u002f\u002ft.co\u002fLkDehj3tNn htt\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6","304: RT @NatGeoChannel: Watch #BeforeTheFlood right here, as @LeoDiCaprio travels the world to tackle climate change https:\u002f\u002ft.co\u002fLkDehj3tNn htt\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6","320: RT @NatGeoChannel: Watch #BeforeTheFlood right here, as @LeoDiCaprio travels the world to tackle climate change https:\u002f\u002ft.co\u002fLkDehj3tNn htt\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6","347: RT @NatGeoChannel: Watch #BeforeTheFlood right here, as @LeoDiCaprio travels the world to tackle climate change https:\u002f\u002ft.co\u002fLkDehj3tNn htt\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6","354: RT @NatGeoChannel: Watch #BeforeTheFlood right here, as @LeoDiCaprio travels the world to tackle climate change https:\u002f\u002ft.co\u002fLkDehj3tNn htt\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6","355: RT @NatGeoChannel: Watch #BeforeTheFlood right here, as @LeoDiCaprio travels the world to tackle climate change https:\u002f\u002ft.co\u002fLkDehj3tNn htt\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6","359: RT @NatGeoChannel: Watch #BeforeTheFlood right here, as @LeoDiCaprio travels the world to tackle climate change https:\u002f\u002ft.co\u002fLkDehj3tNn htt\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6","378: RT @NatGeoChannel: Watch #BeforeTheFlood right here, as @LeoDiCaprio travels the world to tackle climate change https:\u002f\u002ft.co\u002fLkDehj3tNn htt\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6","382: RT @NatGeoChannel: Watch #BeforeTheFlood right here, as @LeoDiCaprio travels the world to tackle climate change https:\u002f\u002ft.co\u002fLkDehj3tNn htt\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6","386: RT @NatGeoChannel: Watch #BeforeTheFlood right here, as @LeoDiCaprio travels the world to tackle climate change https:\u002f\u002ft.co\u002fLkDehj3tNn htt\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6","390: RT @NatGeoChannel: Watch #BeforeTheFlood right here, as @LeoDiCaprio travels the world to tackle climate change https:\u002f\u002ft.co\u002fLkDehj3tNn htt\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a6","413: We must combat climate change.
