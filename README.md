# Interactive-Visualizations-for-AMIGO
The files are for a manuscript named "AMIGO: Algebraic Multi-Grid for Identifying Grouped Objects" which is under review. 
The visualizations are in the sunburst format with each color showing separate cluster of text on different topics. 
You can download the HTML file and click on each section to see the text associated with the numbers. 
Upon acceptance of the paper, the python code for the paper will be publicly available through GitHub.
